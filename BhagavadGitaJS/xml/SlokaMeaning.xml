      <![CDATA[ <i> Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is the widely read theistic science summarized in the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita-mahatmya</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i>Glorification of the Gita</i>]]>). There it says that one should read <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of Sri K???a and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita.</i>]]> It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri K???a.
    </p>
    <p>
      The topics discussed by Dh?tara??ra and Sañjaya, as described in the <![CDATA[ <i>Mahabharata,</i>]]> form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk?etra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word <![CDATA[ <i>dharma-k?etra</i>]]> (a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruk?etra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh?tara??ra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons' ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sañjaya, "What did they do?" He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother Pa??u were assembled in that Field of Kuruk?etra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk?etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> as a place of worship—even for the denizens of heaven—Dh?tara??ra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of Pa??u favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sañjaya was a student of Vyasa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vyasa, Sañjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruk?etra even while he was in the room of Dh?tara??ra. And so, Dh?tara??ra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the Pa??avas and the sons of Dh?tara??ra belong to the same family, but Dh?tara??ra's mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of Pa??u from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh?tara??ra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of Pa??u. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk?etra, where the father of religion, Sri K???a, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh?tara??ra's son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi??hira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words <![CDATA[ <i>dharma-k?etre</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>kuru-k?etre,</i>]]> apart from their historical and Vedic importance.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="2">
    <p>Dh?tara??ra was blind from birth. Unfortunately, he was also bereft of spiritual vision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the Pa??avas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was doubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage, and Sañjaya could understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield. Sañjaya wanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent king and thus assured him that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place. Sañjaya therefore informed the king that his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the military force of the Pa??avas, at once went to the commander in chief, Dro?acarya, to inform him of the real position. Although Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the commander on account of the seriousness of the situation. He was therefore quite fit to be a politician. But Duryodhana''s diplomatic veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the Pa??avas.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="3">
    <p>
      Duryodhana, a great diplomat, wanted to point out the defects of Dro?acarya, the great <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a</i>]]> commander in chief. Dro?acarya had some political quarrel with King Drupada, the father of Draupadi, who was Arjuna''s wife. As a result of this quarrel, Drupada performed a great sacrifice, by which he received the benediction of having a son who would be able to kill Dro?acarya. Dro?acarya knew this perfectly well, and yet as a liberal <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a</i>]]> he did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dh???adyumna, was entrusted to him for military education. Now, on the Battlefield of Kuruk?etra, Dh???adyumna took the side of the Pa??avas, and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the art from Dro?acarya. Duryodhana pointed out this mistake of Dro?acarya''s so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the Pa??avas, who were also Dro?acarya''s affectionate students. Arjuna, especially, was his most affectionate and brilliant student. Duryodhana also warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="4">
    <p>Even though Dh???adyumna was not a very important obstacle in the face of Dro?acarya''s very great power in the military art, there were many others who were causes of fear. They are mentioned by Duryodhana as great stumbling blocks on the path of victory because each and every one of them was as formidable as Bhima and Arjuna. He knew the strength of Bhima and Arjuna, and thus he compared the others with them. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="8">
    <p>Duryodhana mentions the exceptional heroes in the battle, all of whom are ever victorious. Vikar?a is the brother of Duryodhana, Asvatthama is the son of Dro?acarya, and Saumadatti, or Bhurisrava, is the son of the King of the Bahlikas. Kar?a is the half brother of Arjuna, as he was born of Kunti before her marriage with King Pa??u. K?pacarya''s twin sister married Dro?acarya. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="9">
    <p>As far as the others are concerned—like Jayadratha, K?tavarma and Salya—all are determined to lay down their lives for Duryodhana''s sake. In other words, it is already concluded that all of them would die in the Battle of Kuruk?etra for joining the party of the sinful Duryodhana. Duryodhana was, of course, confident of his victory on account of the above-mentioned combined strength of his friends.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="10">
    <p>Herein an estimation of comparative strength is made by Duryodhana. He thinks that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable, being specifically protected by the most experienced general, Grandfather Bhi?ma. On the other hand, the forces of the Pa??avas are limited, being protected by a less experienced general, Bhima, who is like a fig in the presence of Bhi?ma. Duryodhana was always envious of Bhima because he knew perfectly well that if he should die at all, he would only be killed by Bhima. But at the same time, he was confident of his victory on account of the presence of Bhi?ma, who was a far superior general. His conclusion that he would come out of the battle victorious was well ascertained. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="11">
    <p>Duryodhana, after praising the prowess of Bhi?ma, further considered that others might think that they had been considered less important, so in his usual diplomatic way, he tried to adjust the situation in the above words. He emphasized that Bhi?madeva was undoubtedly the greatest hero, but he was an old man, so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides. He might become engaged in the fight, and the enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side. Therefore, it was important that other heroes not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the phalanx. Duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence of Bhi?madeva. He was confident of the full support of Bhi?madeva and Dro?acarya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when Arjuna''s wife Draupadi, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to appear naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the Pa??avas, he hoped that these generals would now completely give it up, as they had done during the gambling performances. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="12">
    <p>The grandsire of the Kuru dynasty could understand the inner meaning of the heart of his grandson Duryodhana, and out of his natural compassion for him he tried to cheer him by blowing his conchshell very loudly, befitting his position as a lion. Indirectly, by the symbolism of the conchshell, he informed his depressed grandson Duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the battle, because the Supreme Lord K???a was on the other side. But still, it was his duty to conduct the fight, and no pains would be spared in that connection. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="14">
    <p>
      In contrast with the conchshell blown by Bhi?madeva, the conchshells in the hands of K???a and Arjuna are described as transcendental. The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because K???a was on the side of the Pa??avas. <![CDATA[ <i>Jayas tu pa??u-putra?a? ye?a? pak?e janardana?.</i>]]> Victory is always with persons like the sons of Pa??u because Lord K???a is associated with them. And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of Vi??u, or Lord K???a. Besides that, the chariot on which both the friends were seated had been donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="15">
    <p>Lord K???a is referred to as H??ikesa in this verse because He is the owner of all senses. The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and therefore the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses. But He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kuruk?etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H??ikesa. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhusudana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Vasudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devaki-nandana because He accepted Devaki as His mother; His name is Yasoda-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Yasoda at V?ndavana; His name is Partha-sarathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is H??ikesa because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk?etra.</p>
    <p>Arjuna is referred to as Dhanañjaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the king to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bhima is known as V?kodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hi?imba. So the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the Pa??avas, beginning with the Lord''s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord K???a, the supreme director, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So they were predestined to lose the battle—and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="19">
    <p>When Bhi?ma and the others on the side of Duryodhana blew their respective conchshells, there was no heart-breaking on the part of the Pa??avas. Such occurrences are not mentioned, but in this particular verse it is mentioned that the hearts of the sons of Dh?tara??ra were shattered by the sounds vibrated by the Pa??avas'' party. This is due to the Pa??avas and their confidence in Lord K???a. One who takes shelter of the Supreme Lord has nothing to fear, even in the midst of the greatest calamity.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="20">
    <p>The battle was just about to begin. It is understood from the above statement that the sons of Dh?tara??ra were more or less disheartened by the unexpected arrangement of military force by the Pa??avas, who were guided by the direct instructions of Lord K???a on the battlefield. The emblem of Hanuman on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanuman cooperated with Lord Rama in the battle between Rama and Rava?a, and Lord Rama emerged victorious. Now both Rama and Hanuman were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord K???a is Rama Himself, and wherever Lord Rama is, His eternal servitor Hanuman and His eternal consort Sita, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord K???a, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="23">
    <p>It was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the Pa??avas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dh?tara??ra. Therefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have been birds of the same feather. Arjuna wanted to see them on the battlefield before the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of proposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although he was quite confident of victory because K???a was sitting by his side.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="24">
    <p>
      In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gu?akesa. <![CDATA[ <i>Gu?aka</i>]]> means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called <![CDATA[ <i>gu?akesa.</i>]]> Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with K???a. As a great devotee of K???a, he could not forget K???a even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of K???a''s name, form, qualities and pastimes. Thus a devotee of K???a can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of K???a constantly. This is called K???a consciousness, or <![CDATA[ <i>samadhi.</i>]]> As H??ikesa, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, K???a could understand Arjuna''s purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="25">
    <p>As the Supersoul of all living entities, Lord K???a could understand what was going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word H??ikesa in this connection indicates that He knew everything. And the word Partha, meaning "the son of Prtha, or Kunti," is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a friend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of P?tha, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what did K???a mean when He told Arjuna to "behold the Kurus"? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? K???a never expected such things from the son of His aunt P?tha. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicted by the Lord in friendly joking. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="26">
    <p>On the battlefield Arjuna could see all kinds of relatives. He could see persons like Bhurisrava, who were his father''s contemporaries, grandfathers Bhi?ma and Somadatta, teachers like Dro?acarya and K?pacarya, maternal uncles like Salya and Sakuni, brothers like Duryodhana, sons like Lak?ma?a, friends like Asvatthama, well-wishers like K?tavarma, etc. He could see also the armies which contained many of his friends. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="28">
    <p>Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities which are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee, however advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture, lacks in godly qualities. As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And while he was so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna''s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but he was also crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:</p>
    <p>
      yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcana<br/>
      sarvair gu?ais tatra samasate sura?<br/>
      harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gu?a<br/>
      mano-rathenasati dhavato bahi?
    </p>
    <p>
      "One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy." (<![CDATA[ <i> <bd->SB</bd-></i>]]><bd>
        5.18.12)
      </bd>
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="29">
    <p>There are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of standings of the hair on end. Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental realization. Arjuna''s symptoms in this situation are out of material fear-namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow Ga??iva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="30">
    <p>
      Due to his impatience, Arjuna was unable to stay on the battlefield, and he was forgetting himself on account of this weakness of his mind. Excessive attachment for material things puts a man in such a bewildering condition of existence. <![CDATA[ <i>Bhaya? dvitiyabhinivesata? syat</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i>SB</i>]]> 11.2.37): such fearfulness and loss of mental equilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by material conditions. Arjuna envisioned only painful reverses in the battlefield—he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe. The words <![CDATA[ <i>nimittani viparitani</i>]]> are significant. When a man sees only frustration in his expectations, he thinks, "Why am I here?" Everyone is interested in himself and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is showing ignorance of his real self-interest by K???a''s will. One''s real self-interest lies in Vi??u, or K???a. The conditioned soul forgets this, and therefore suffers material pains. Arjuna thought that his victory in the battle would only be a cause of lamentation for him.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="1" sloka="31">
    <p>
      Without knowing that one''s self-interest is in Vi??u (or K???a), conditioned souls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in such situations. In such a blind conception of life, they forget even the causes of material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya.</i>]]> It is said that two kinds of men, namely the <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya</i>]]> who dies directly in front of the battlefield under K???a''s personal orders and the person in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to enter into the sun globe, which is so powerful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thinks that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he is not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as a <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya,</i>]]> he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because the <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriyas</i>]]> cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has no kingdom. Arjuna''s sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lies in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.

      According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: (1) a poison giver, (2) one who sets fire to the house, (3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, (4) one who plunders riches, (5) one who occupies another''s land, and (6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya.</i>]]> Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord Rama was so saintly that people even now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord Rama (<![CDATA[ <i>rama-rajya</i>]]>), but Lord Rama never showed any cowardice. Rava?a was an aggressor against Rama because Rava?a kidnapped Rama''s wife, Sita, but Lord Rama gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna''s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and the pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna''s addressing of K???a as "Madhava," or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to K???a that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. K???a, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.

      In the system of the <![CDATA[ <i>var?asrama</i>]]> institution there are many principles of religious traditions to help members of the family grow properly and attain spiritual values. The elder members are responsible for such purifying processes in the family, beginning from birth to death. But on the death of the elder members, such family traditions of purification may stop, and the remaining younger family members may develop irreligious habits and thereby lose their chance for spiritual salvation. Therefore, for no purpose should the elder members of the family be slain.

      Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity and spiritual progress in life. The <![CDATA[ <i>var?asrama</i>]]> religion''s principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the general spiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery. According to Ca?akya Pa??ita, women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy. So the different family traditions of religious activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the <![CDATA[ <i>var?asrama</i>]]> system. On the failure of such <![CDATA[ <i>var?asrama-dharma,</i>]]> naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence.

      According to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This offering is performed by worship of Vi??u, because eating the remnants of food offered to Vi??u can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions. Sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of <![CDATA[ <i>prasadam</i>]]> food are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can deliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery. It is stated in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavatam</bd-> </i>]]> <bd>(11.5.41):

      Arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience, but on what he has heard from the authorities. That is the way of receiving real knowledge. One cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without being helped by the right person who is already established in that knowledge. There is a system in the <![CDATA[ <i>var?asrama</i>]]> institution by which before death one has to undergo the process of atonement for his sinful activities. One who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of atonement called the <![CDATA[ <i>prayascitta.</i>]]> Without doing so, one surely will be transferred to hellish planets to undergo miserable lives as the result of sinful activities.

      It is the custom—according to <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya</i>]]> fighting principles—that an unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, decided that even if attacked by the enemy in such an awkward position, he would not fight. He did not consider how much the other party was bent upon fighting. All these symptoms are due to soft-heartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the Lord.

      To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In other words, desire for becoming K???a conscious is actually desirelessness. To understand one''s actual position as the eternal servitor of K???a, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K???a consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because K???a is the proprietor of everything, everything must be used for the satisfaction of K???a. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully K???a conscious he fought because K???a wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K???a the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire for the satisfaction of K???a, not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to K???a (<![CDATA[ <i>isavasyam ida? sarvam<it-> [<it>Iso<it-><it>mantra<it>1<it->]</it-></it></it></it-></it></it-></i>]]>), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization-namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is an eternal part and parcel of K???a in spiritual identity, and that the eternal position of the living entity is therefore never on the level of K???a or greater than Him. This understanding of K???a consciousness is the basic principle of real peace.

      One can attain K???a consciousness or divine life at once, within a second—or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha?va?ga Maharaja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto K???a. <![CDATA[ <i>Nirva?a</i>]]> means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K???a conscious, he at once attains the stage of <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-nirva?a.</i>]]> There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of K???a consciousness. Attainment of K???a consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K???a consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.

      Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore <![CDATA[ <i>brahmi sthiti</i>]]> means "not on the platform of material activities."

      The Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri K???a has very elaborately described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view to delivering His intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief. And the path of realization has been recommended: <![CDATA[ <i>buddhi-yoga,</i>]]> or K???a consciousness. Sometimes K???a consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully K???a conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord K???a. But without being trained in the philosophy of K???a consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of K???a in a secluded place, where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of K???a consciousness or <![CDATA[ <i>buddhi-yoga,</i>]]> or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using K???a consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned K???a as to his best course of action. In answer, Lord K???a elaborately explained <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yoga,</i>]]> or work in K???a consciousness, in this Third Chapter.

      In the previous chapter, as a prelude to the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> many different paths were explained, such as <![CDATA[ <i>sa?khya-yoga, buddhi-yoga,</i>]]> control of the senses by intelligence, work without fruitive desire, and the position of the neophyte. This was all presented unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path would be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation. Although K???a had no intention of confusing Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of K???a consciousness—either by inertia or by active service. In other words, by his questions he is clearing the path of K???a consciousness for all students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]>

          , the Lord explained two kinds of procedures—namely <![CDATA[ <i>sa?khya-yoga</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yoga,</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>buddhi-yoga.</i>]]> In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. <![CDATA[ <i>Sa?khya-yoga,</i>]]> or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work in K???a consciousness, as it is explained in the <it->
            61st verse of the Second Chapter<it>
              . The Lord has explained, also in the <it->
                39th verse<it>, that by working by the principles of <![CDATA[ <i><it->b<it>uddhi-yoga,</it></it-></i>]]> or K???a consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in the 61st verse—that this <![CDATA[ <i>buddhi-yoga</i>]]> is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on K???a), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the <![CDATA[ <i>yogas</i>]]> are interdependent, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is K???a, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K???a consciousness. This is also stated in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of K???a consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting everything with K???a in K???a consciousness. Of these two, the path of K???a consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process. K???a consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime.</it>

      The renounced order of life can be accepted when one has been purified by the discharge of the prescribed form of duties which are laid down just to purify the hearts of materialistic men. Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life (<![CDATA[ <i>sannyasa</i>]]>). According to the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasa,</i>]]> or retiring from fruitive activities, one at once becomes as good as Naraya?a. But Lord K???a does not approve this principle. Without purification of heart, <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasa</i>]]> is simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (<![CDATA[ <i>buddhi-yoga</i>]]>). <![CDATA[ <i> <it>Sv-alpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat<it>.</it> </it></i>]]><it>

      It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of K???a consciousness; otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the <![CDATA[ <i>sastras.</i>]]> But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of K???a consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>
        (1.5.17) affirms this:
        <p>
          tyaktva sva-dharma? cara?ambuja? harer<br/>
          bhajann apakvo ''tha patet tato yadi<br/>

          ko vartha apto ''bhajata? sva-dharmata?
        </p>
        <p>
          "If someone takes to K???a consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the <![CDATA[ <i>sastras</i>]]> or execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the <![CDATA[ <i>sastras,</i>]]> what does it avail him if he is not K???a conscious?" So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of K???a consciousness. Therefore, <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasa,</i>]]> or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming K???a conscious, without which everything is considered a failure.

      There are many pretenders who refuse to work in K???a consciousness but make a show of meditation, while actually dwelling within the mind upon sense enjoyment. Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order to bluff sophisticated followers, but according to this verse these are the greatest cheaters. For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order, but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he can make gradual progress in purifying his existence. But he who makes a show of being a <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification must be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of philosophy. His knowledge has no value, because the effects of such a sinful man''s knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the Lord. Such a pretender''s mind is always impure, and therefore his show of yogic meditation has no value whatsoever.

      Instead of becoming a pseudo transcendentalist for the sake of wanton living and sense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one&quot;s own business and execute the purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage and enter into the kingdom of God. The prime <![CDATA[ <i>svartha-gati,</i>]]> or goal of self-interest, is to reach Vi??u. The whole institution of <![CDATA[ <i>var?a</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>asrama</i>]]> is designed to help us reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in K???a consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a controlled life, as prescribed in the <![CDATA[ <i>sastras,</i>]]> and continue carrying out his business without attachment, and in that way make progress. A sincere person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender who adopts show—bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates only for the sake of making a living.

    <p>
      There are many pseudo meditators who misrepresent themselves as belonging to high parentage, and great professional men who falsely pose that they have sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiritual life. Lord K???a did not want Arjuna to become a pretender. Rather, the Lord desired that Arjuna perform his prescribed duties as set forth for <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriyas.</i>]]> Arjuna was a householder and a military general, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his religious duties as prescribed for the householder <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya.</i>]]> Such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to maintain one''s body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification. Such polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.

  <slokas chapter="3" sloka="9">
    <p>
      Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled. <![CDATA[ <i>Yajña</i>]]> means Lord Vi??u, or sacrificial performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Vi??u. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> enjoin: <![CDATA[ <i>yajño vai vi??u.</i>]]> In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas</i>]]> or directly serves Lord Vi??u. K???a consciousness is therefore performance of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> as it is prescribed in this verse. The <![CDATA[ <i>var?asrama</i>]]> institution also aims at satisfying Lord Vi??u. <![CDATA[ <i>Var?asramacaravata puru?e?a para? puman/ vi??ur aradhyate</i>]]> [<it>Cc. Madhya<it>8.58] (<![CDATA[ <i> <bd->Vi??u Pura?a</bd-></i>]]><bd>3.8.9).
      <p>Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Vi??u. Any other work done in this material world will be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in K???a consciousness to satisfy K???a (or Vi??u); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord K???a, or under the direct instruction of Lord K???a Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K???a. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God. </p></bd></it></it>

      The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Vi??u) is a chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back home—back to Godhead. All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Vi??u, or K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation, as it is stated in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita:</i>]]><it><![CDATA[ <i>vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedya?<it>.</it></i>]]> The Lord says that the purpose of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: <![CDATA[ <i>pati? visvasyatmesvaram.</i>]]> Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi??u. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> also (2.4.20) Srila Sukadeva Gosvami describes the Lord as <![CDATA[ <i>pati</i>]]> in so many ways:
        <p>
          sriya? patir yajña-pati? praja-patir<br/>
          dhiya? patir loka-patir dhara-pati?<br/>

        </p>
        <p>
          The <![CDATA[ <i>praja-pati</i>]]> is Lord Vi??u, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world to enable the conditioned souls to learn how to perform <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas</i>]]> (sacrifices) for the satisfaction of Vi??u, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety and after finishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña,</i>]]> the conditioned souls gradually become K???a conscious and become godly in all respects. In the Age of Kali, the <![CDATA[ <i>sa?kirtana-yajña</i>]]> (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. <![CDATA[ <i>Sa?kirtana-yajña</i>]]> and K???a consciousness go well together.

      The devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in K???a consciousness, are called <![CDATA[ <i>santas,</i>]]> and they are always in love with the Lord as it is described in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd> (5.38): <![CDATA[ <i>premañjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa? sadaiva h?daye?u vilokayanti.</i>]]> The <![CDATA[ <i>santas,</i>]]> being always in a compact of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or K???a (the all-attractive person), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such devotees always perform <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas</i>]]> in different modes of devotional service, such as <![CDATA[ <i>srava?am, kirtanam, smara?am, arcanam <it->[<it>SB<it-> </it-></it></it-></i>]]><it>7.5.23]<![CDATA[ <i>,</i>]]> etc., and these performances of <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas</i>]]> keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification, are not only thieves but also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore, in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to perform the easy process of <![CDATA[ <i>sa?kirtana-yajña,</i>]]> in full K???a consciousness. Otherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in the world.</it></bd>

      Srila Baladeva Vidyabhu?a?a, a great commentator on the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> writes as follows: <![CDATA[ <i>ye indrady-a?gatayavasthita? yajña? sarvesvara? vi??um abhyarcya tac-che?am asnanti tena tad deha-yatra? sampadayanti, te santa? sarvesvarasya yajña-puru?asya bhakta? sarva-kilbi?air anadi-kala-viv?ddhair atmanubhava-prati bandhakair nikhilai? papair vimucyante.</i>]]> The Supreme Lord, who is known as the <![CDATA[ <i>yajña-puru?a,</i>]]> or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra and Varu?a are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord K???a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in K???a consciousness, offer food to K???a and then eat—a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi??u and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K???a consciousness, who eats only food offered to K???a, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting <![CDATA[ <i>prasadam</i>]]> of the Lord (food offered to Vi??u) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity—that is the law of nature. <![CDATA[ <i>Yajña,</i>]]> specifically the <![CDATA[ <i>sa?kirtana-yajña</i>]]> prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.

      <![CDATA[ <i>Yajñartha-karma,</i>]]> or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of K???a only, is more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of the <![CDATA[ <i>yajña-puru?a,</i>]]> Vi??u, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman, or the transcendental <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas.</i>]]> The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> are therefore codes of working directions. Anything performed without the direction of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> is called <![CDATA[ <i>vikarma,</i>]]> or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take direction from the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, one similarly has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said, <![CDATA[ <i>asya mahato bhutasya nisvasitam etad yad ?g-vedo yajur-veda? samavedo ''tharva?girasa?.</i>]]> "The four <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]>-namely the <![CDATA[ <i>?g Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda,</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>Atharva Veda</i>]]>—are all emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead." (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->B?had-ara?yaka Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>4.5.11) The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, for as it is confirmed in the <![CDATA[ <i>Brahma-sa?hita,</i>]]> the Lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one''s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> by becoming K???a conscious. Even those who have not followed the Vedic injunctions may adopt the principles of K???a consciousness, and that will take the place of performance of Vedic <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas,</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>karmas.</i>]]>

      The mammonist philosophy of "work very hard and enjoy sense gratification" is condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas</i>]]> is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature''s law, this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways—namely <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yoga, jñana-yoga,</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga.</i>]]> There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas</i>]]> for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above mentioned cycle of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not K???a conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas</i>]]> are directly aimed at the particular demigods mentioned in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas.</i>]]> Indirectly, it is the practice of K???a consciousness, because when one masters the performance of <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas</i>]]> one is sure to become K???a conscious. But if by performing <![CDATA[ <i>yajñas</i>]]> one does not become K???a conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain K???a consciousness.

      A person who is <![CDATA[ <i>fully</i>]]> K???a conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts in K???a consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform. Due to his being K???a conscious, all impiety within is instantly cleansed, an effect of many, many thousands of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> performances. By such clearing of consciousness, one becomes fully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord, and therefore he no longer has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions. Such a K???a conscious person is no longer interested in material activities and no longer takes pleasure in material arrangements like wine, women and similar infatuations.

  <slokas chapter="3" sloka="18">
    <p>A self-realized man is no longer obliged to perform any prescribed duty, save and except activities in K???a consciousness. K???a consciousness is not inactivity either, as will be explained in the following verses. A K???a conscious man does not take shelter of any person—man or demigod. Whatever he does in K???a consciousness is sufficient in the discharge of his obligation. </p>

    <p>The Supreme is the Personality of Godhead for the devotees, and liberation for the impersonalist. A person, therefore, acting for K???a, or in K???a consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna is told that he should fight in the Battle of Kuruk?etra for the interest of K???a because K???a wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a.</p>
    <p>Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of impious activities that were performed in the field of sense gratification. But action in K???a consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A K???a conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of K???a alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached. </p>

      Kings like Janaka were all self-realized souls; consequently they had no obligation to perform the prescribed duties in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas.</i>]]> Nonetheless they performed all prescribed activities just to set examples for the people in general. Janaka was the father of Sita and father-in-law of Lord Sri Rama. Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but because he was the king of Mithila (a subdivision of Bihar province in India), he had to teach his subjects how to perform prescribed duties. Lord K???a and Arjuna, the Lord''s eternal friend, had no need to fight in the Battle of Kuruk?etra, but they fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kuruk?etra, every effort was made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other party was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity for fighting. Although one who is situated in K???a consciousness may not have any interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and how to act. Experienced persons in K???a consciousness can act in such a way that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse.

      People in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical behavior. A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smokes. Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly before he begins teaching. One who teaches in that way is called <![CDATA[ <i>acarya,</i>]]> or the ideal teacher. Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of <![CDATA[ <i>sastra</i>]]> (scripture) to teach the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like <![CDATA[ <i>Manu-sa?hita</i>]]> and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus the leader''s teaching should be based on the principles of such standard <![CDATA[ <i>sastras.</i>]]> One who desires to improve himself must follow the standard rules as they are practiced by the great teachers. The <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> also affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head of a state, the father and the schoolteacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in general. All such natural leaders have a great responsibility to their dependents; therefore they must be conversant with standard books of moral and spiritual codes.

      "He does not possess a bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity. There is no difference between His body and His soul. He is absolute. All His senses are transcendental.

In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord K???a descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and imitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at any time. The <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd->  </i>]]><bd>(10.33.30-31) affirms:

          We should always consider the position of the <![CDATA[ <i>isvaras,</i>]]> or those who can actually control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior.

Lord Siva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many pseudo devotees of Lord Siva who want to indulge in smoking <![CDATA[ <i>gañja</i>]]> (marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord Siva they are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some pseudo devotees of Lord K???a who prefer to imitate the Lord in His <![CDATA[ <i>rasa-lila,</i>]]> or dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification.

    <p>Two persons, one in K???a consciousness and the other in material consciousness, working on the same level, may appear to be working on the same platform, but there is a wide gulf of difference in their respective positions. The person in material consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of everything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by material nature, which works under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. The materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of K???a. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing everything independently, and that is the symptom of his nescience. He does not know that this gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such his bodily and mental activities should be engaged in the service of K???a, in K???a consciousness. The ignorant man forgets that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as H??ikesa, or the master of the senses of the material body, for due to his long misuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the false ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with K???a. </p>

      The knower of the Absolute Truth is convinced of his awkward position in material association. He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, and that his position should not be in the material creation. He knows his real identity as part and parcel of the Supreme, who is eternal bliss and knowledge, and he realizes that somehow or other he is entrapped in the material conception of life. In his pure state of existence he is meant to dovetail his activities in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. He therefore engages himself in the activities of K???a consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the activities of the material senses, which are all circumstantial and temporary. He knows that his material condition of life is under the supreme control of the Lord; consequently he is not disturbed by all kinds of material reactions, which he considers to be the mercy of the Lord. According to <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i>]]> one who knows the Absolute Truth in three different features—namely Brahman, Paramatma, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead—is called <![CDATA[ <i>tattva-vit,</i>]]> for he knows also his own factual position in relationship with the Supreme.

      Persons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material consciousness and are full of material designations. This body is a gift of the material nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness is called <![CDATA[ <i>manda,</i>]]> or a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul. Ignorant men think of the body as the self; they accept bodily connections with others as kinsmanship, the land in which the body is obtained is their object of worship, and they consider the formalities of religious rituals to be ends in themselves. Social work, nationalism and altruism are some of the activities for such materially designated persons. Under the spell of such designations, they are always busy in the material field; for them spiritual realization is a myth, and so they are not interested. Those who are enlightened in spiritual life, however, should not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one''s own spiritual activities silently. Such bewildered persons may be engaged in such primary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially benevolent work.

    <p>Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in K???a consciousness, and therefore Lord K???a advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable time.

      This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The Lord instructs that one has to become fully K???a conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on K???a, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independent of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord, because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was therefore ordered by Sri K???a to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully K???a conscious, is called <![CDATA[ <i>adhyatma-cetas.</i>]]> <![CDATA[ <i>Nirasi?</i>]]> means that one has to act on the order of the master but should not expect fruitive results. The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is the real purport of <![CDATA[ <i>mayi,</i>]]> or "unto Me." And when one acts in such K???a consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called <![CDATA[ <i>nirmama,</i>]]> or "nothing is mine." And if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order, which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become <![CDATA[ <i>vigata-jvara,</i>]]> or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in K???a consciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation.

      The injunction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, is the essence of all Vedic wisdom and therefore is eternally true without exception. As the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> are eternal, so this truth of K???a consciousness is also eternal. One should have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the Lord. There are many philosophers who write comments on the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> but have no faith in K???a. They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action. But an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of <![CDATA[ <i>karma.</i>]]> In the beginning of K???a consciousness, one may not fully discharge the injunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely be promoted to the stage of pure K???a consciousness.

  <slokas chapter="3" sloka="32">
    <p>The flaw of not being K???a conscious is clearly stated herein. As there is punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head, so there is certainly punishment for disobedience to the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A disobedient person, however great he may be, is ignorant of his own self, and of the Supreme Brahman, Paramatma and the Personality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart. Therefore there is no hope of perfection of life for him. </p>

      Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of K???a consciousness, he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14). Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of <![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]> simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose as advanced in the science but inwardly or privately are completely under particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature, he is in bondage. K???a consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties in terms of material existence. Therefore, without being fully in K???a consciousness, one should not give up his occupational duties. No one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> or transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be situated in one''s position and to try to attain K???a consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches of K???a''s <![CDATA[ <i>maya.</i>]]>

  <slokas chapter="3" sloka="34">
    <p>Those who are in K???a consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in material sense gratification. But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. According to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one''s wife. All other women are to be considered as one''s mother. But in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratification under regulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But attachment to K???a consciousness, or acting always in the loving service of K???a, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one should try to be detached from K???a consciousness at any stage of life. The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of K???a consciousness. </p>

      One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full K???a consciousness rather than those prescribed for others. Materially, prescribed duties are duties enjoined according to one''s psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master for the transcendental service of K???a. But whether material or spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another''s prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for his particular situation and should not imitate others. For example, a <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a,</i>]]> who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya,</i>]]> who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya</i>]]> it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a</i>]]> who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in K???a consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. In that complete stage of K???a consciousness, the <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya</i>]]> may act as a <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a,</i>]]> or a <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a</i>]]> may act as a <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya.</i>]]> In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For example, Visvamitra was originally a <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya,</i>]]> but later on he acted as a <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a,</i>]]> whereas Parasurama was a <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a</i>]]> but later on he acted as a <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya.</i>]]> Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of K???a consciousness.

    <p>A living entity, as part and parcel of the Supreme, is originally spiritual, pure, and free from all material contaminations. Therefore, by nature he is not subject to the sins of the material world. But when he is in contact with the material nature, he acts in many sinful ways without hesitation, and sometimes even against his will. As such, Arjuna''s question to K???a is very sanguine, as to the perverted nature of the living entities. Although the living entity sometimes does not want to act in sin, he is still forced to act. Sinful actions are not, however, impelled by the Supersoul within, but are due to another cause, as the Lord explains in the next verse. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="3" sloka="37">
    <p>When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for K???a is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.</p>
    <p>This inquiry is the beginning of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedanta-sutras,</i>]]> wherein it is said, <![CDATA[ <i><it>athato brahma jijñasa<it>:</it></it></i>]]> one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined in <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> as <![CDATA[ <i><it>janmady asya yato ''nvayad itaratas ca<it>,</it></it></i>]]> or, "The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman." Therefore the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into K???a consciousness—or, in other words, desiring everything for K???a—then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanuman, the great servitor of Lord Rama, exhibited his wrath by burning the golden city of Rava?a, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the Lord. Here also, in <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in K???a consciousness, become our friends instead of our enemies.

    <p>There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure consciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living entity exhibits his K???a consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning of K???a consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts, and the smoke-covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a human being, the living entity may revive a little K???a consciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of K???a consciousness under able guidance. </p>

  <slokas chapter="3" sloka="39">
    <p>
      It is said in the <![CDATA[ <i>Manu-sm?ti</i>]]> that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of sense enjoyment, just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply of fuel. In the material world, the center of all activities is sex, and thus this material world is called <![CDATA[ <i>maithunya-agara,</i>]]> or the shackles of sex life. In the ordinary prison house, criminals are kept within bars; similarly, the criminals who are disobedient to the laws of the Lord are shackled by sex life. Advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity. Therefore, this lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within the material world. While one enjoys sense gratification, it may be that there is some feeling of happiness, but actually that so-called feeling of happiness is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer.

  <slokas chapter="3" sloka="40">
    <p>
      The enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the conditioned soul, and therefore Lord K???a is giving hints of those places, so that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found. Mind is the center of all the activities of the senses, and thus when we hear about sense objects the mind generally becomes a reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and the senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is the immediate next—door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence influences the spirit soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the mind and senses. The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness. This false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(10.84.13):
        <p>
          yasyatma-buddhi? ku?ape tri-dhatuke<br/>

      The Lord advised Arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning so that he could curb the greatest sinful enemy, lust, which destroys the urge for self-realization and specific knowledge of the self. <![CDATA[ <i>Jñana</i>]]> refers to knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or in other words, knowledge that the spirit soul is not the body. <![CDATA[ <i>Vijñana</i>]]> refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul''s constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.9.31):
        <p>
          jñana? parama-guhya? me<br/>

          "The knowledge of the self and Supreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if explained with their various aspects by the Lord Himself." <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> gives us that general and specific knowledge of the self. The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K???a consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this K???a consciousness, and thereby one may become fully K???a conscious and act accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in K???a consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, K???a consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K???a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead—the highest perfectional stage of human life. </p>

  <slokas chapter="3" sloka="42">
    <p>
      The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or K???a consciousness. In K???a consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act—as it does during dreaming. But above the mind is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and senses, will be automatically engaged. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Ka?ha Upani?ad</i>]]> there is a similar passage, in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance that the senses will become engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. <![CDATA[ <i><it>para? d???va nivartate<it>.</it></it></i>]]><it>
        <it>
          If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Ka?ha Upani?ad</i>]]> the soul has been described as <![CDATA[ <i>mahan,</i>]]> the great. Therefore the soul is above all-namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.
          <p>With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in K???a consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of the senses. But aside from that, one has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one''s mind in K???a consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with K???a in K???a consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind. </p>

      This Third Chapter of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is conclusively directive to K???a consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness the ultimate end. In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature. Desire for overlording and for sense gratification is the greatest enemy of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of K???a consciousness, one can control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing K???a consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mind—by steady intelligence directed toward one''s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in K???a consciousness by higher intelligence.

            <p>
              "In the beginning of the millennium known as Treta-yuga this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvan to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Maharaja Ik?vaku, the king of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord Ramacandra appeared. Therefore, <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> existed in human society from the time of Maharaja Ik?vaku."

              At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dvapara-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Treta-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> to his disciple and son Maharaja Ik?vaku, the king of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> was spoken by the Lord to His disciple the sun-god Vivasvan, a rough estimate is that the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita,</i>]]> according to the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Sri K???a. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasvan because he is also a <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriya</i>]]> and is the father of all <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriyas</i>]]> who are descendants of the sun-god, or the <![CDATA[ <i>surya-va?sa k?atriyas.</i>]]> Because <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is as good as the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas,</i>]]> being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is <![CDATA[ <i>apauru?eya,</i>]]> superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation.

As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> (especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, although they make a good business on the words of Sri K???a.

There are a number of editions of this great book of knowledge. Some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of them have commentaries by the demons.

      Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K???a''s words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that K???a should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or K???a. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence. Of course, K???a also appeared as the son of Devaki on this earth. How K???a remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before K???a so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That K???a is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since K???a is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that K???a would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of K???a. Therefore, when K???a Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by K???a Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study K???a from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of K???a when they are spoken by K???a Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K???a because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider K???a an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K???a is superhuman, that He is <![CDATA[ <i>sac-cid-ananda-vigraha</i>]]><it><![CDATA[ <i><it->[<it>Bs. </it></it-></i>]]>5.1<it->]<it>—the eternal form of bliss and knowledge—that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of K???a, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of K???a. Arjuna''s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider K???a to be an ordinary human being, subject to the modes of material nature. <p></p></it></it-></it>

      In the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.33) we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:<p></p>

        <p>"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K???a], who is the original person—absolute, infallible, without beginning. Although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually not understood by even the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees."</p>
        <p>
          It is also stated in <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.39):<p></p>
            <p>
              ramadi-murti?u kala-niyamena ti??han<br/>

            </p>
            <p>
              "I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K???a], who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rama, N?si?ha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as K???a, and who incarnates personally also."
            </p>
            <p>
              In the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the <![CDATA[ <i>vaid</i>]]><it>u<![CDATA[ <i><it>rya</it></i>]]> stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><it>vede?u durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau</it></i>]]><it>). Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord K???a spoke the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> to the sun-god Vivasvan, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the <![CDATA[ <i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> as infallible (<![CDATA[ <i>acyuta</i>]]>), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> cannot be understood by demonic brains. K???a remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K???a and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His <![CDATA[ <i>sac-cid-ananda</i>]]> body. He is <![CDATA[ <i>advaita,</i>]]> which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit—whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And because the Lord''s body and self are identical, His position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse. <p></p>

    <p>
      The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past "births," whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K???a. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His <![CDATA[ <i>prak?ti,</i>]]> or His form. <![CDATA[ <i>Prak?ti</i>]]> means "nature," as well as <![CDATA[ <i>svarupa,</i>]]> or "one''s own form." The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, K???a appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body, it still appears that Lord K???a grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk?etra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of K???a in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation—past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun''s rising, moving before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because Lord K???a''s appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency—and He is never contaminated by material nature. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in multimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavatam,</i>]]> He appears before His mother as Naraya?a, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon the living entities so that they can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, and not on mental concoctions or imaginations, which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the Lord''s forms to be. The word <![CDATA[ <i>maya,</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>atma-maya,</i>]]> refers to the Lord''s causeless mercy, according to the <![CDATA[ <i>Visva-kosa</i>]]> dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse.

    <p>
      The word <![CDATA[ <i>s?jami</i>]]> is significant herein. <![CDATA[ <i>S?jami</i>]]> cannot be used in the sense of creation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord''s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore, <![CDATA[ <i>s?jami</i>]]> means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of the Dvapara-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium of the seventh Manu in one day of Brahma, He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas,</i>]]> and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> makes one irreligious. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavatam</i>]]> it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahma, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of <![CDATA[ <i>dharma,</i>]]> or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<![CDATA[ <i>dharma? tu sak?ad bhagavat-pra?itam<it->[<it>SB<it-> </it-></it></it-></i>]]><it>6.3.19]). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The purpose of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita,</i>]]> that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord appears. From the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavatam</i>]]> we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K???a who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas.</i>]]> Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas,</i>]]> people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every <![CDATA[ <i>avatara,</i>]]> or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an <![CDATA[ <i>avatara</i>]]> unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same—to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.<p></p>
        <p>
          The principles of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginner''s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse K???a consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.

    <p>
      According to <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> a <![CDATA[ <i>sadhu</i>]]> (holy man) is a man in K???a consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of K???a consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a <![CDATA[ <i>sadhu.</i>]]> And <![CDATA[ <i>du?k?tam</i>]]> applies to those who do not care for K???a consciousness. Such miscreants, or <![CDATA[ <i>du?k?tam,</i>]]> are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in K???a consciousness is accepted as a <![CDATA[ <i>sadhu,</i>]]> even though such a person may be neither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Rava?a and Ka?sa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahlada Maharaja was the son of Hira?yakasipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devaki, the mother of K???a, was the sister of Ka?sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because K???a was to be born of them. So Lord K???a appeared primarily to deliver Devaki, rather than kill Ka?sa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.

        <p>
          "The <![CDATA[ <i>avatara,</i>]]> or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or <![CDATA[ <i>avatara.</i>]]> Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name <![CDATA[ <i>avatara.</i>]]>"
        </p>
        <p>
          There are various kinds of <![CDATA[ <i>avataras,</i>]]> such as <![CDATA[ <i>puru?avataras, gu?avataras, lilavataras, sakty-avesa avataras, manvantara-avataras</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>yugavataras</i>]]>—all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K???a is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all <![CDATA[ <i>avataras.</i>]]> Lord Sri K???a descends for the specific purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original V?ndavana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the K???a <![CDATA[ <i>avatara</i>]]> is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the Age of Kali. As stated in the <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i>]]> the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the worship of K???a by the <![CDATA[ <i>sa?kirtana</i>]]> movement (congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread K???a consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of <![CDATA[ <i>sa?kirtana</i>]]> would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of K???a, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the <![CDATA[ <i>Upani?ads, Mahabharata</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavatam.</i>]]> The devotees of Lord K???a are very much attracted by the <![CDATA[ <i>sa?kirtana</i>]]> movement of Lord Caitanya. This <![CDATA[ <i>avatara</i>]]> of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by His causeless mercy.

      The Lord''s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the <![CDATA[ <i>yogis</i>]]> attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve—merging into the impersonal <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> of the Lord—is only partial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning to this material world. In the <![CDATA[ <i>
        <bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd->
      </i>]]>
      <bd>
        (5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations: <![CDATA[ <i>advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam.</i>]]> Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i>Puru?a-bodhini Upani?ad</i>]]>):<p></p>
        <p>
          eko devo nitya-lilanurakto<br/>

        </p>
        <p>
          "The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees." This Vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> personally by the Lord. He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The Vedic version <![CDATA[ <i>tat tvam asi</i>]]> is actually applied in this case. Anyone who understands Lord K???a to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord "You are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead," is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:
        </p>
        <p>
          tam eva viditvati m?tyum eti<br/>
          nanya? pantha vidyate ''yanaya
        </p>
        <p>
          "One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there is no other way to achieve this perfection." (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>3.8) That there is no alternative means that anyone who does not understand Lord K???a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and consequently he will not attain salvation simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> according to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed-up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate K???a consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection. <p></p>

      As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists cannot even imagine that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of material consciousness: attachment to material life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called <![CDATA[ <i>bhava,</i>]]> or transcendental love of Godhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhakti-rasam?ta-sindhu</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.4.15-16), the science of devotional service:<p></p>
        <p>
          adau sraddha tata? sadhu-<br/>
          sa?go ''tha bhajana-kriya<br/>

        </p>
        <p>
          "In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In the next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for K???a consciousness, which is matured in <![CDATA[ <i>bhava,</i>]]> or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called <![CDATA[ <i>prema,</i>]]> the highest perfectional stage of life." In the <![CDATA[ <i>prema</i>]]> stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one''s individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations that result in void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.

      Everyone is searching for K???a in the different aspects of His manifestations. K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His impersonal <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But K???a is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, K???a is the object of everyone''s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one''s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, K???a reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want K???a as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son, and still another as his lover. K???a rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, K???a helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the <![CDATA[ <i>yajñesvara;</i>]]> and those who are <![CDATA[ <i>yogis</i>]]> seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of K???a consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.3.10):

      There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God''s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> say, <![CDATA[ <i>nityo nityanam:</i>]]> God is one. <![CDATA[ <i><it>Isvara? parama? k???a?<it>.</it></it></i>]]><it><it>The Supreme God is one—K???a—and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (<![CDATA[ <i>nityanam</i>]]>) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God—Naraya?a, Vi??u, or K???a. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or <![CDATA[ <i>pa?a??i.</i>]]> Even the great demigods like Brahma and Siva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahma and Siva (<![CDATA[ <i>siva-viriñci-nutam</i>]]><it->[<it>SB<it-><it>11.5.33<it->]<it>). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. <![CDATA[ <i>Iha devata?</i>]]> denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But Naraya?a, Vi??u, or K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even Sripada Sa?karacarya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that Naraya?a, or K???a, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (<![CDATA[ <i>h?ta-jñana <it->[<it>Bg<it->. </it-></it></it-></i>]]><it>7.20]) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K???a consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or "big guns" in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in K???a consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in K???a consciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.</it></it></it-></it></it-></it></it-></it></it>

      The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?as</i>]]> due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriyas</i>]]> due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the <![CDATA[ <i>vaisyas,</i>]]> are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the <![CDATA[ <i>sudras,</i>]]> or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord K???a does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above-mentioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of K???a consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K???a consciousness, however, is above even the <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?as.</i>]]> Although <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?as</i>]]> by quality are supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, most of them approach only the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord K???a. But a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a</i>]]> and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri K???a, becomes a person in K???a consciousness—or, in other words, a Vai??ava. K???a consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of K???a, namely Rama, N?si?ha, Varaha, etc. And as K???a is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in K???a consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.

      As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the activities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic <![CDATA[ <i>sm?ti</i>]]> confirms this fact as follows:
    </p>
    <p>

      "In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature, by which the cosmic manifestation is made visible." The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities. In the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Vedanta-sutra</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.1.34) it is confirmed, <![CDATA[ <i>vai?amya-nairgh??ye na sapek?atvat:</i>]]> the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of <![CDATA[ <i>karma,</i>]]> or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in K???a consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of <![CDATA[ <i>karma.</i>]]> One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reactions. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in K???a consciousness.

    <p>There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. K???a consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty things can take to the line of K???a consciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same K???a consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefited. Foolish persons or neophytes in K???a consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of K???a consciousness. Arjuna''s desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of K???a consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of K???a consciousness is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of K???a. Arjuna is here advised to act in K???a consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord''s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasvan, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of persons who acted in K???a consciousness in the past. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some millions of years before. All such students of Lord K???a are mentioned here as past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by K???a. </p>

  <slokas chapter="4" sloka="16">
    <p>Action in K???a consciousness has to be executed in accord with the examples of previous bona fide devotees. This is recommended in the 15th verse. Why such action should not be independent will be explained in the text to follow.</p>
    <p>To act in K???a consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter. The system of K???a consciousness was first narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son Ik?vaku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time. Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of K???a consciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in K???a consciousness directly. Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.</p>
    <p>It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid down by the Lord Himself. <![CDATA[ <i>Dharma? tu sak?ad bhagavat-pra?itam</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->SB</bd-></i>]]><bd>6.3.19). No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahma, Siva, Narada, Manu, the Kumaras, Kapila, Prahlada, Bhi?ma, Sukadeva Gosvami, Yamaraja, Janaka, and Bali Maharaja. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in K???a consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.</bd>

      If one is serious about liberation from material bondage, one has to understand the distinctions between action, inaction and unauthorized actions. One has to apply oneself to such an analysis of action, reaction and perverted actions because it is a very difficult subject matter. To understand K???a consciousness and action according to its modes, one has to learn one''s relationship with the Supreme; i.e., one who has learned perfectly knows that every living entity is an eternal servitor of the Lord and that consequently one has to act in K???a consciousness. The entire <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is directed toward this conclusion. Any other conclusions, against this consciousness and its attendant actions, are <![CDATA[ <i>vikarmas,</i>]]> or prohibited actions. To understand all this one has to associate with authorities in K???a consciousness and learn the secret from them; this is as good as learning from the Lord directly. Otherwise, even the most intelligent persons will be bewildered.

      A person acting in K???a consciousness is naturally free from the bonds of <![CDATA[ <i>karma.</i>]]> His activities are all performed for K???a; therefore he does not enjoy or suffer any of the effects of work. Consequently he is intelligent in human society, even though he is engaged in all sorts of activities for K???a. <![CDATA[ <i>Akarma</i>]]> means without reaction to work. The impersonalist ceases fruitive activities out of fear, so that the resultant action may not be a stumbling block on the path of self-realization, but the personalist knows rightly his position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he engages himself in the activities of K???a consciousness. Because everything is done for K???a, he enjoys only transcendental happiness in the discharge of this service. Those who are engaged in this process are known to be without desire for personal sense gratification. The sense of eternal servitorship to K???a makes one immune to all sorts of reactionary elements of work.

  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="4" sloka="19">
    <p>Only a person in full knowledge can understand the activities of a person in K???a consciousness. Because the person in K???a consciousness is devoid of all kinds of sense-gratificatory propensities, it is to be understood that he has burned up the reactions of his work by perfect knowledge of his constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is actually learned who has attained to such perfection of knowledge. Development of this knowledge of eternal servitorship to the Lord is compared to fire. Such a fire, once kindled, can burn up all kinds of reactions to work. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="4" sloka="20">
    <p>
      This freedom from the bondage of actions is possible only in K???a consciousness, when one is doing everything for K???a. A K???a conscious person acts out of pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he has no attraction for the results of the action. He is not even attached to his personal maintenance, for everything is left to K???a. Nor is he anxious to secure things, nor to protect things already in his possession. He does his duty to the best of his ability and leaves everything to K???a. Such an unattached person is always free from the resultant reactions of good and bad; it is as though he were not doing anything. This is the sign of <![CDATA[ <i>akarma,</i>]]> or actions without fruitive reactions. Any other action, therefore, devoid of K???a consciousness, is binding upon the worker, and that is the real aspect of <![CDATA[ <i>vikarma,</i>]]> as explained hereinbefore.

  <slokas chapter="4" sloka="21">
    <p>A K???a conscious person does not expect good or bad results in his activities. His mind and intelligence are fully controlled. He knows that because he is part and parcel of the Supreme, the part played by him, as a part and parcel of the whole, is not his own activity but is only being done through him by the Supreme. When the hand moves, it does not move out of its own accord, but by the endeavor of the whole body. A K???a conscious person is always dovetailed with the supreme desire, for he has no desire for personal sense gratification. He moves exactly like a part of a machine. As a machine part requires oiling and cleaning for maintenance, so a K???a conscious man maintains himself by his work just to remain fit for action in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. He is therefore immune to all the reactions of his endeavors. Like an animal, he has no proprietorship even over his own body. A cruel proprietor of an animal sometimes kills the animal in his possession, yet the animal does not protest. Nor does it have any real independence. A K???a conscious person, fully engaged in self-realization, has very little time to falsely possess any material object. For maintaining body and soul, he does not require unfair means of accumulating money. He does not, therefore, become contaminated by such material sins. He is free from all reactions to his actions. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="4" sloka="22">
    <p>A K???a conscious person does not make much endeavor even to maintain his body. He is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their own accord. He neither begs nor borrows, but he labors honestly as far as is in his power, and is satisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor. He is therefore independent in his livelihood. He does not allow anyone''s service to hamper his own service in K???a consciousness. However, for the service of the Lord he can participate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality of the material world. The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat and cold, or misery and happiness. A K???a conscious person is above duality because he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of K???a. Therefore he is steady both in success and in failure. These signs are visible when one is fully in transcendental knowledge. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="4" sloka="23">
    <p>Becoming fully K???a conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus is free from the contaminations of the material modes. He can become liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with K???a, and thus his mind cannot be drawn from K???a consciousness. Consequently, whatever he does, he does for K???a, who is the primeval Vi??u. Therefore, all his works are technically sacrifices because sacrifice aims at satisfying the Supreme Person, K???a (or Vi??u). The resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into transcendence, and one does not suffer material effects. </p>

      How activities in K???a consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in K???a consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of K???a consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K???a consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K???a consciousness as set forth here in the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita.</i>]]> This process is generally known as <![CDATA[ <i>yajña,</i>]]> or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Vi??u, or K???a. The more the activities of the material world are performed in K???a consciousness, or for Vi??u only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. The word <![CDATA[ <i>brahma</i>]]> (Brahman) means "spiritual." The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir,</i>]]> His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir,</i>]]> but when the <![CDATA[ <i>jyoti</i>]]> is covered by illusion (<![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]>) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by K???a consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of K???a consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result are—all combined together—Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by <![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]> is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K???a consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in K???a consciousness, it is said to be in <![CDATA[ <i>samadhi,</i>]]> or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called <![CDATA[ <i>yajña,</i>]]> or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance, and the result or ultimate gain—everything—becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K???a consciousness.
    </p>

  <slokas chapter="4" sloka="25">
    <p>
      As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in K???a consciousness is also called a perfect <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> or a first-class mystic. But there are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factually sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi??u, who is also known as Yajña. All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in K???a consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals. They are called <![CDATA[ <i>bahv-isvara-vadi,</i>]]> or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists sacrifice their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman. The K???a conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of K???a, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self—everything—is sacrificed for K???a. Thus, he is the first-class <![CDATA[ <i>yogi;</i>]]> but he does not lose his individual existence.

      The members of the four divisions of human life, namely the <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacari,</i>]]> the <![CDATA[ <i>g?hastha,</i>]]> the <![CDATA[ <i>vanaprastha</i>]]> and the <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasi,</i>]]> are all meant to become perfect <![CDATA[ <i>yogis</i>]]> or transcendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacaris,</i>]]> or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining from sense gratification. A <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacari</i>]]> hears only words concerning K???a consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacari</i>]]> engages fully in <![CDATA[ <i>harer namanukirtanam</i>]]>—chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound vibration of Hare K???a, Hare K???a. Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat-eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratification. Marriage on the principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher, transcendental life.

      The <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system conceived by Patañjali is referred to herein. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Yoga-sutra</i>]]> of Patañjali, the soul is called <![CDATA[ <i>pratyag-atma</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>parag-atma.</i>]]> As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called <![CDATA[ <i>parag-atma,</i>]]> but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called <![CDATA[ <i>pratyag-atma.</i>]]> The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Patañjali system of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> instructs one on how to control the functions of the body''s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system, <![CDATA[ <i>pratyag-atma</i>]]> is the ultimate goal. This <![CDATA[ <i>pratyag-atma</i>]]> is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the <![CDATA[ <i>pra?a-vayu.</i>]]> The <![CDATA[ <i>apana-vayu</i>]]> goes downwards, <![CDATA[ <i>vyana-vayu</i>]]> acts to shrink and expand, <![CDATA[ <i>samana-vayu</i>]]> adjusts equilibrium, <![CDATA[ <i>udana-vayu</i>]]> goes upwards—and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization.

      These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like <![CDATA[ <i>dharma-sala, anna-k?etra, atithi-sala, anathalaya</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>vidya-pi?ha.</i>]]> In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are called <![CDATA[ <i>dravyamaya-yajña.</i>]]> There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as <![CDATA[ <i>candraya?a</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>caturmasya.</i>]]> These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the <![CDATA[ <i>caturmasya</i>]]> vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day or does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called <![CDATA[ <i>tapomaya-yajña.</i>]]> There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic <![CDATA[ <i>yogas</i>]]> like the Patañjali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or <![CDATA[ <i>ha?ha-yoga</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>a??a?ga-yoga</i>]]> (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called <![CDATA[ <i>yoga-yajña,</i>]]> sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the <![CDATA[ <i>Upani?ads</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>Vedanta-sutras,</i>]]> or the Sa?khya philosophy. All of these are called <![CDATA[ <i>svadhyaya-yajña.</i>]]> or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these <![CDATA[ <i>yogis</i>]]> are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life. K???a consciousness, however, is different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord. K???a consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifice but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide devotees. Therefore, K???a consciousness is transcendental.

      This system of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> for controlling the breathing process is called <![CDATA[ <i>pra?ayama,</i>]]> and in the beginning it is practiced in the <![CDATA[ <i>ha?ha-yoga</i>]]> system through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the airs within the body so as to reverse the directions of their passage. The <![CDATA[ <i>apana</i>]]> air goes downward, and the <![CDATA[ <i>pra?a</i>]]> air goes up. The <![CDATA[ <i>pra?ayama-yogi</i>]]> practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into <![CDATA[ <i>puraka.</i>]]> equilibrium. Offering the exhaled breath into the inhaled breath is called <![CDATA[ <i>recaka.</i>]]> When both air currents are completely stopped, one is said to be in <![CDATA[ <i>kumbhaka-yoga.</i>]]> By practice of <![CDATA[ <i>kumbhaka-yoga.</i>]]> one can increase the duration of life for perfection in spiritual realization. The intelligent <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> is interested in attaining perfection in one life, without waiting for the next. For by practicing <![CDATA[ <i>kumbhaka-yoga.</i>]]> the <![CDATA[ <i>yogis</i>]]> increase the duration of life by many, many years. A K???a conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of K???a, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord K???a; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation, as stated in <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(14.26):

          "One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord transcends the modes of material nature and is immediately elevated to the spiritual platform." A K???a conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only <![CDATA[ <i>k???a-prasadam,</i>]]> or food which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement.

      From the foregoing explanation of different types of sacrifice (namely sacrifice of one''s possessions, study of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> or philosophical doctrines, and performance of the <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system), it is found that the common aim of all is to control the senses. Sense gratification is the root cause of material existence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from sense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this advancement in life, not only does one become happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a.

      Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his real situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one''s dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas,</i>]]> therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By performance of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> we can have enough food, enough milk, etc.—even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> (sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> according to the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas,</i>]]> how can he expect a happy life even in this body, and what to speak of another body on another planet? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña.</i>]]> But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of K???a consciousness. A life of K???a consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence.

      Different types of sacrifice, as discussed above, are mentioned in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> to suit the different types of worker. Because men are so deeply absorbed in the bodily concept, these sacrifices are so arranged that one can work either with the body, with the mind, or with the intelligence. But all of them are recommended for ultimately bringing about liberation from the body. This is confirmed by the Lord herewith from His own mouth.

      The purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete knowledge, then to gain release from material miseries, and, ultimately, to engage in loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (K???a consciousness). Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of sacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one''s faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real knowledge culminates in K???a consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on differences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes called <![CDATA[ <i>karma-ka??a</i>]]> (fruitive activities) and sometimes <![CDATA[ <i>jñana-ka??a</i>]]> (knowledge in the pursuit of truth). It is better when the end is knowledge.

      The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(6.3.19) says, <![CDATA[ <i>dharma? tu sak?ad bhagavat-pra?itam:</i>]]> the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. Not only should one hear submissively from the spiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.</bd>

      The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri K???a. The sense of an existence separate from K???a is called <![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i>ma</i>]]>-not, <![CDATA[ <i>ya</i>]]>-this). Some think that we have nothing to do with K???a, that K???a is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of K???a. K???a, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> it is clearly stated that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of K???a. The Mayavadi philosophers wrongly think that K???a loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the Mayavadi philosophers fail to understand that <![CDATA[ <i>absolute</i>]]> means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.
    </p>
    <p>
      For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K???a. Although we are separated parts of K???a, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is <![CDATA[ <i>maya,</i>]]> or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy K???a. By <![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]> alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with K???a. The whole teaching of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> is targeted toward this end: that a living being, as K???a''s eternal servitor, cannot be separated from K???a, and his sense of being an identity apart from K???a is called <![CDATA[ <i>maya.</i>]]> The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through K???a consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to K???a. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K???a, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of K???a. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in K???a consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.10.6): <![CDATA[ <i>muktir hitvanyatha-rupa? svarupe?a vyavasthiti?.</i>]]> Liberation means to be situated in one''s constitutional position as an eternal servitor of K???a (K???a consciousness).</bd>

  <slokas chapter="4" sloka="36">
    <p>Proper understanding of one''s constitutional position in relationship to K???a is so nice that it can at once lift one from the struggle for existence which goes on in the ocean of nescience. This material world is sometimes regarded as an ocean of nescience and sometimes as a blazing forest. In the ocean, however expert a swimmer one may be, the struggle for existence is very severe. If someone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer from the ocean, he is the greatest savior. Perfect knowledge, received from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the path of liberation. The boat of K???a consciousness is very simple, but at the same time the most sublime. </p>

      Perfect knowledge of self and Superself and of their relationship is compared herein to fire.

There are many stages of reaction: reaction in the making, reaction fructifying, reaction already achieved, and reaction <![CDATA[ <i>a priori.</i>]]> But knowledge of the constitutional position of the living entity burns everything to ashes. When one is in complete knowledge, all reactions, both <![CDATA[ <i>a priori</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>a posteriori,</i>]]> are consumed. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->B?had-ara?yaka Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>4.4.22) it is stated, <![CDATA[ <i>ubhe uhaivai?a ete taraty am?ta? sadhv-asadhuni:</i>]]> "One overcomes both the pious and impious reactions of work."</bd>

      When we speak of transcendental knowledge, we do so in terms of spiritual understanding. As such, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge. Ignorance is the cause of our bondage, and knowledge is the cause of our liberation. This knowledge is the mature fruit of devotional service, and when one is situated in transcendental knowledge, he need not search for peace elsewhere, for he enjoys peace within himself. In other words, this knowledge and peace culminate in K???a consciousness. That is the last word in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]>

    <p>Such knowledge in K???a consciousness can be achieved by a faithful person who believes firmly in K???a.

This faith is attained by the discharge of devotional service, and by chanting Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, which cleanses one''s heart of all material dirt. Over and above this, one should control the senses. A person who is faithful to K???a and who controls the senses can easily attain perfection in the knowledge of K???a consciousness without delay. </p>

      Out of many standard and authoritative revealed scriptures, the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is the best. Persons who are almost like animals have no faith in, or knowledge of, the standard revealed scriptures; and some, even though they have knowledge of, or can cite passages from, the revealed scriptures, have actually no faith in these words. And even though others may have faith in scriptures like <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> they do not believe in or worship the Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a. Such persons cannot have any standing in K???a consciousness. They fall down. Out of all the above-mentioned persons, those who have no faith and are always doubtful make no progress at all. Men without faith in God and His revealed word find no good in this world, nor in the next. For them there is no happiness whatsoever. One should therefore follow the principles of revealed scriptures with faith and thereby be raised to the platform of knowledge. Only this knowledge will help one become promoted to the transcendental platform of spiritual understanding. In other words, doubtful persons have no status whatsoever in spiritual emancipation.

      The <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system instructed in this chapter is called <![CDATA[ <i>sanatana-yoga,</i>]]> or eternal activities performed by the living entity. This <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> has two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one''s material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of one''s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one''s own self (or one''s constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial, for such a person can easily understand the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of K???a consciousness. K???a consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic <![CDATA[ <i>yoga,</i>]]> in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in studying the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas,</i>]]> and in partaking of the social institution called <![CDATA[ <i>var?asrama-dharma.</i>]]> All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks <![CDATA[ <i>that</i>]]> objective is the real student of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> but one who doubts the authority of K???a falls back. One is therefore advised to study <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> as it is expressed in the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]>

      In this Fifth Chapter of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> the Lord says that work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this material encagement by <![CDATA[ <i>buddhi-yoga,</i>]]> or devotional service, was also explained therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the Fourth Chapter the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, K???a has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasa,</i>]]> or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity, because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether or work with full knowledge.

      Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.5.4-6) confirms this as follows:

        </p>
        <p>"People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one''s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about his real identity. As long as he does not know his real identity, he has to work for fruitive results for sense gratification, and as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to Vasudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence."</p>
        <p>
          Therefore, <![CDATA[ <i>jñana</i>]]> (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to <![CDATA[ <i>act</i>]]> in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K???a consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one''s advancement in real knowledge. Without K???a consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K???a consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore action in K???a consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without K???a consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by Srila Rupa Gosvami in his <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhakti-rasam?ta-sindhu</bd-></i>]]><bd>(<it>1.2.256<it>):

                  "When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking them to be material, their renunciation is called incomplete." Renunciation is complete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is K???a''s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to K???a, everything should be employed in the service of K???a. This perfect form of action in K???a consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasi</i>]]> of the Mayavadi school.

He knows fully well that K???a is the whole and that he is part and parcel of K???a. Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and quantitatively correct. The concept of oneness with K???a is incorrect because the part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality yet different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become full in himself, having nothing to aspire to or lament over. There is no duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for K???a. Being thus freed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated—even in this material world. </p>

      The aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of existence. The soul of the material world is Vi??u, or the Supersoul. Devotional service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is to find the root of the tree, and the other is to water the root. The real student of Sa?khya philosophy finds the root of the material world, Vi??u, and then, in perfect knowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord. Therefore, in essence, there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Vi??u. Those who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of Sa?khya and <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yoga</i>]]> are not the same, but one who is learned knows the unifying aim in these different processes.

      The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of life. Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By Sa?khya philosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and parcel of the material world but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in K???a consciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the first process, Sa?khya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> process one has to attach himself to the work of K???a consciousness. Factually, both processes are the same, although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve attachment. Detachment from matter and attachment to K???a are one and the same. One who can see this sees things as they are.

      There are two classes of <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis,</i>]]> or persons in the renounced order of life. The Mayavadi <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis</i>]]> are engaged in the study of Sa?khya philosophy, whereas the Vai??ava <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis</i>]]> are engaged in the study of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavatam</i>]]> philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedanta-sutras.</i>]]> The Mayavadi <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis</i>]]> also study the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedanta-sutras,</i>]]> but use their own commentary, called <![CDATA[ <i>Sariraka-bha?ya,</i>]]> written by Sa?karacarya. The students of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavata</i>]]> school are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, according to <![CDATA[ <i>pañcaratriki</i>]]> regulations, and therefore the Vai??ava <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis</i>]]> have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vai??ava <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis</i>]]> have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the Mayavadi <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis,</i>]]> engaged in the studies of Sa?khya and Vedanta and speculation, cannot relish the transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavatam</i>]]> without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the Mayavadi <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis.</i>]]> The Vai??ava <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis,</i>]]> who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The Mayavadi <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis</i>]]> sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in K???a conscious activities are better situated than the <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis</i>]]> engaged in simple speculation about what is Brahman and what is not Brahman, although they too come to K???a consciousness, after many births.

    <p>One who is on the path of liberation by K???a consciousness is very dear to every living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his K???a consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from K???a, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body. Because one who works in K???a consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on K???a, there is no chance of his being deviated from K???a. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to K???a; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to K???a; and he does not wish to go anywhere if K???a is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, "Why then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn''t he in K???a consciousness?" Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of Kuruk?etra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of K???a, who was personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruk?etra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the orders of K???a in full K???a consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in the reactions of work. </p>

      Here <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?i</i>]]> means in K???a consciousness. The material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the <![CDATA[ <i>pradhana.</i>]]> The Vedic hymns <![CDATA[ <i>sarva? hy etad brahma</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Ma??ukya Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>2), <![CDATA[ <i>tasmad etad brahma nama rupam anna? ca jayate</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Mu??aka Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.1.9), and, in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(14.3), <![CDATA[ <i>mama yonir mahad brahma</i>]]> indicate that everything in the material world is a manifestation of Brahman; and although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the cause. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Isopani?ad</i>]]> it is said that everything is related to the Supreme Brahman, or K???a, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to K???a, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one''s material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in K???a consciousness. It is then beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(3.30), <![CDATA[ <i>mayi sarva?i karma?i sannyasya:</i>]]> "Resign all works unto Me [K???a]." The conclusion is that a person without K???a consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in K???a consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of K???a and should therefore be engaged in the service of K???a. <p></p></bd></bd></bd></bd>

      When one acts in K???a consciousness for the satisfaction of the senses of K???a, any action, whether of the body, mind, intelligence or even the senses, is purified of material contamination. There are no material reactions resulting from the activities of a K???a conscious person. Therefore purified activities, which are generally called <![CDATA[ <i>sad-acara,</i>]]> can be easily performed by acting in K???a consciousness. Sri Rupa Gosvami in his <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhakti-rasam?ta-sindhu</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.2.187) describes this as follows:<p></p>
        <p>
          iha yasya harer dasye<br/>
          karma?a manasa gira<br/>
          nikhilasv apy avasthasu<br/>
          jivan-mukta? sa ucyate
        </p>
        <p>"A person acting in K???a consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of K???a) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities." He has no false ego, for he does not believe that he is this material body, or that he possesses the body. He knows that he is not this body and that this body does not belong to him. He himself belongs to K???a, and the body too belongs to K???a. When he applies everything produced of the body, mind, intelligence, words, life, wealth, etc.—whatever he may have within his possession—to K???a''s service, he is at once dovetailed with K???a. He is one with K???a and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is the body, etc. This is the perfect stage of K???a consciousness. </p>

      The difference between a person in K???a consciousness and a person in bodily consciousness is that the former is attached to K???a whereas the latter is attached to the results of his activities. The person who is attached to K???a and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he has no anxiety over the results of his work. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavatam,</i>]]> the cause of anxiety over the result of an activity is explained as being one''s functioning in the conception of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. K???a is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In K???a consciousness, there is no duality. All that exists is a product of K???a''s energy, and K???a is all good. Therefore, activities in K???a consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are transcendental and have no material effect. One is therefore filled with peace in K???a consciousness. But one who is entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of K???a consciousness-realization that there is no existence besides K???a is the platform of peace and fearlessness.

    <p>The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body, or the figurative city of the body, are conducted automatically by its particular modes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and therefore suffers. By K???a consciousness, he can revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to K???a consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities. In such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily within the city of nine gates. The nine gates are mentioned as follows:</p>
    <p>
      nava-dvare pure dehi<br/>
      ha?so lelayate bahi?<br/>
      vasi sarvasya lokasya<br/>

      "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a living entity, is the controller of all living entities all over the universe. The body consists of nine gates [two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, the anus and the genitals]. The living entity in his conditioned stage identifies himself with the body, but when he identifies himself with the Lord within himself, he becomes just as free as the Lord, even while in the body." (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>3.18)<p></p><p>Therefore, a K???a conscious person is free from both the outer and inner activities of the material body. </p></bd>

    <p>The living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one of the energies or natures of the Supreme Lord but is distinct from matter, which is another nature—called inferior—of the Lord. Somehow the superior nature, the living entity, has been in contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in ignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental K???a consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil. </p>

      The Sanskrit word <![CDATA[ <i>vibhu</i>]]> means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not. The Lord is <![CDATA[ <i>vibhu,</i>]]> or omniscient, but the living entity is <![CDATA[ <i>a?u,</i>]]> or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Paramatma, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning for the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independent living entities. However, when one desires K???a, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare, <![CDATA[ <i>e?a u hy eva sadhu karma karayati ta? yam ebhyo lokebhya unnini?ate.</i>]]> <![CDATA[ <i>e?a u evasadhu karma karayati yam adho nini?ate:</i>]]> "The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so that he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so that he may go to hell." (<bd-><![CDATA[ <i>Kau?itaki Upani?ad<bd></bd></i>]]> 3.8) Similarly, the <it>Mahabharata, (Vana-parva<it>31.27) states:<p></p>
            <p>
              ajño jantur aniso ''yam<br/>
              atmana? sukha-du?khayo?<br/>
              isvara-prerito gacchet<br/>
              svarga? vasv abhram eva ca
            </p>
            <p>"The living entity is completely dependent in his distress and happiness. By the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air."</p>
            <p>
              Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid K???a consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Vedanta-sutras</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.1.34) also confirm this. <![CDATA[ <i>Vai?amya-nairgh??ye na sapek?atvat tatha hi darsayati:</i>]]> "The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to." <p></p></bd>

      Those who have forgotten K???a must certainly be bewildered, but those who are in K???a consciousness are not bewildered at all. It is stated in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> <it><![CDATA[ <i>sarva? jñana-plavena,</i>]]><![CDATA[ <i>jñanagni? sarva-karma?i</i>]]><it>and <it><![CDATA[ <i>na hi jñanena sad?sam.</i>]]><it>Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K???a, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: <![CDATA[ <i>bahuna? janmanam ante jñanavan ma? prapadyate.</i>]]> After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto K???a, or when one attains K???a consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect K???a consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what K???a consciousness is, for K???a consciousness will certainly drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K???a conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one''s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord Sri K???a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in daytime, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge. <p></p></it></it></it></it>

      The Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord K???a. The whole <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> centers around the declaration that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature. <![CDATA[ <i>Para-tattva</i>]]> means the Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute. There is nothing more than that. The Lord says, <![CDATA[ <i><it>matta? paratara? nanyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya<it>.</it></it>
      </i>]]> Impersonal Brahman is also supported by K???a: 
          <![CDATA[ <i><it>brahma?o hi prati??haham<it>.</it></it></i>]]><it><it>
          Therefore in all ways K???a is the Supreme Reality. One whose mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in K???a, or, in other words, one who is fully in K???a consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A K???a conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity and individuality) in K???a, and, equipped with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of liberation. <p></p>

      A K???a conscious person does not make any distinction between species or castes. The <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a</i>]]> and the outcaste may be different from the social point of view, or a dog, a cow, and an elephant may be different from the point of view of species, but these differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a learned transcendentalist. This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Paramatma, is present in everyone''s heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Paramatma regardless of the circumstances of the living entities. The Lord as Paramatma is present both in the outcaste and in the <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a,</i>]]> although the body of a <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a</i>]]> and that of an outcaste are not the same. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in that particular body whereas the Paramatma is present in each and every body. A K???a conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction.

    <p>Equanimity of mind, as mentioned above, is the sign of self-realization. Those who have actually attained to such a stage should be considered to have conquered material conditions, specifically birth and death. As long as one identifies with this body, he is considered a conditioned soul, but as soon as he is elevated to the stage of equanimity through realization of self, he is liberated from conditional life. In other words, he is no longer subject to take birth in the material world but can enter into the spiritual sky after his death. The Lord is flawless because He is without attraction or hatred. Similarly, when a living entity is without attraction or hatred, he also becomes flawless and eligible to enter into the spiritual sky. Such persons are to be considered already liberated, and their symptoms are described below. </p>

  <slokas chapter="5" sloka="20">

      The symptoms of the self-realized person are given herein. The first symptom is that he is not illusioned by the false identification of the body with his true self. He knows perfectly well that he is not this body, but is the fragmental portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is therefore not joyful in achieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything which is related to his body. This steadiness of mind is called <![CDATA[ <i>sthira-buddhi,</i>]]> or self-intelligence. He is therefore never bewildered by mistaking the gross body for the soul, nor does he accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul. This knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing the complete science of the Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. He thus knows his constitutional position perfectly well, without falsely trying to become one with the Supreme in all respects. This is called Brahman realization, or self-realization. Such steady consciousness is called K???a consciousness.

A person in <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-yoga,</i>]]> or K???a consciousness, is so absorbed in the loving service of the Lord that he loses his taste for material sense pleasure altogether. The highest pleasure in terms of matter is sex pleasure. The whole world is moving under its spell, and a materialist cannot work at all without this motivation. But a person engaged in K???a consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure, which he avoids. That is the test in spiritual realization. Spiritual realization and sex pleasure go ill together. A K???a conscious person is not attracted to any kind of sense pleasure, due to his being a liberated soul.

      If one wants to make steady progress on the path of self-realization, he must try to control the forces of the material senses. There are the forces of talk, forces of anger, forces of mind, forces of the stomach, forces of the genitals, and forces of the tongue. One who is able to control the forces of all these different senses, and the mind, is called <![CDATA[ <i>gosvami,</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>svami.</i>]]> Such <![CDATA[ <i>gosvamis</i>]]> live strictly controlled lives, and forgo altogether the forces of the senses. Material desires, when unsatiated, generate anger, and thus the mind, eyes and chest become agitated. Therefore, one must practice to control them before one gives up this material body. One who can do this is understood to be self-realized and is thus happy in the state of self-realization. It is the duty of the transcendentalist to try strenuously to control desire and anger.

      Unless one is able to relish happiness from within, how can one retire from the external engagements meant for deriving superficial happiness? A liberated person enjoys happiness by factual experience. He can, therefore, sit silently at any place and enjoy the activities of life from within. Such a liberated person no longer desires external material happiness. This state is called <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-bhuta <it->[<it>SB 4.30.20<it->]<it>,</it></it-></it></it-></i>]]> attaining which one is assured of going back to Godhead, back to home.

    <p>Only a person who is fully in K???a consciousness can be said to be engaged in welfare work for all living entities. When a person is actually in the knowledge that K???a is the fountainhead of everything, then when he acts in that spirit he acts for everyone. The sufferings of humanity are due to forgetfulness of K???a as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor, and the supreme friend. Therefore, to act to revive this consciousness within the entire human society is the highest welfare work. One cannot be engaged in such first-class welfare work without being liberated in the Supreme. A K???a conscious person has no doubt about the supremacy of K???a. He has no doubt because he is completely freed from all sins. This is the state of divine love.</p>
    <p>A person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human society cannot factually help anyone. Temporary relief of the external body and the mind is not satisfactory. The real cause of one''s difficulties in the hard struggle for life may be found in one''s forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord. When a man is fully conscious of his relationship with K???a, he is actually a liberated soul, although he may be in the material tabernacle. </p>

      Of the saintly persons who are constantly engaged in striving toward salvation, one who is in K???a consciousness is the best of all. The <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(4.22.39) confirms this fact as follows:
        <p>
          yat-pada-pa?kaja-palasa-vilasa-bhaktya<br/>
          karmasaya? grathitam udgrathayanti santa?<br/>

          sroto-ga?as tam ara?a? bhaja vasudevam
        </p>
        <p>"Just try to worship, in devotional service, Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even great sages are not able to control the forces of the senses as effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by serving the lotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep-grown desire for fruitive activities."</p>
        <p>In the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so deep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such desires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in devotional service in K???a consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in self-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analogous example of this:</p>
        <p>
          darsana-dhyana-sa?sparsair<br/>
          matsya-kurma-viha?gama?<br/>

          tathaham api padma-ja
        </p>
        <p>"By vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!"</p>
        <p>
          The fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise brings up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid on land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, the devotee in K???a consciousness, although far away from the Lord''s abode, can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly—by engagement in K???a consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this state of life is called <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-nirva?a,</i>]]> or the absence of material miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Supreme.

      The conditioned souls within the clutches of the illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K???a is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>6.7) the Supreme Lord is described as <![CDATA[ <i>tam isvara?a? parama? mahesvara?.</i>]]> Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of K???a consciousness: Lord K???a is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K???a consciousness.<p></p>
        <p>
          This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K???a consciousness, generally known as <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yoga.</i>]]> The question of mental speculation as to how <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yoga</i>]]> can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K???a consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K???a consciousness is <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>jñana-yoga</i>]]> is a path leading to <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga.</i>]]> K???a consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one''s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K???a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with <![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]> (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over <![CDATA[ <i>maya,</i>]]> and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K???a consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one''s practical performance of duties in K???a consciousness, which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And one who stands fast in K???a consciousness, controlling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the transcendental stage, or <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-nirva?a.</i>]]> The eightfold <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> mysticism is automatically practiced in K???a consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of <![CDATA[ <i>yama, niyama, asana, pra?ayama, pratyahara, dhara?a, dhyana</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>samadhi.</i>]]> But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.

          Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the

      In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the Age of Kali. Although the eightfold <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yoga,</i>]]> or acting in K???a consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K???a consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in K???a consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasi,</i>]]> the perfect <![CDATA[ <i>yogi.</i>]]>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis</i>]]> sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform <![CDATA[ <i>agnihotra yajñas</i>]]> (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to become one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> who practices the <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in K???a consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A K???a conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of K???a, and thus he is the perfect <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasi,</i>]]> or perfect <![CDATA[ <i>yogi.</i>]]> Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way:
    </p>

    <p>
      Real <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasa-yoga</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti</i>]]> means that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no separate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K???a conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the <![CDATA[ <i>yogis</i>]]> who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K???a consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K???a. Therefore, a K???a conscious person is simultaneously a <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasi</i>]]> and a <![CDATA[ <i>yogi.</i>]]> The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the <![CDATA[ <i>jñana</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> processes, is automatically served in K???a consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then <![CDATA[ <i>jñana</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A K???a conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction, because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All purposes are perfectly served by the practice of K???a consciousness.

      The process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called <![CDATA[ <i>yoga.</i>]]> It may be compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization. This ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises up to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life. According to various elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all in all, the complete ladder is called <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> and may be divided into three parts, namely <![CDATA[ <i>jñana-yoga, dhyana-yoga</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga.</i>]]> The beginning of the ladder is called the <![CDATA[ <i>yogaruruk?u</i>]]> stage, and the highest rung is called <![CDATA[ <i>yogaru?ha.</i>]]>
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the eightfold <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system, attempts in the beginning to enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered fruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the practice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.
    </p>
    <p>A K???a conscious person, however, is situated from the beginning on the platform of meditation because he always thinks of K???a. And, being constantly engaged in the service of K???a, he is considered to have ceased all material activities. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="6" sloka="4">
    <p>
      When a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense gratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without K???a consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish activities. But a K???a conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of K???a and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> ladder.

      The word <![CDATA[ <i>atma</i>]]> denotes body, mind and soul—depending upon different circumstances. In the <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system, the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important. Since the mind is the central point of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practice, <![CDATA[ <i>atma</i>]]> refers here to the mind. The purpose of the <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because the mind is involved with the false ego, which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in K???a consciousness. The word <![CDATA[ <i>hi</i>]]> is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one <![CDATA[ <i>must</i>]]> do this. It is also said:
    </p>
    <p>
      mana eva manu?ya?a?<br/>
      kara?a? bandha-mok?ayo?<br/>
      bandhaya vi?ayasa?go<br/>
      muktyai nirvi?aya? mana?
    </p>
    <p>
      "For man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation. Mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage, and mind detached from the sense objects is the cause of liberation." (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Am?ta-bindu Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>2) Therefore, the mind which is always engaged in K???a consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation.<p></p>

  <slokas chapter="6" sloka="6">
    <p>
      The purpose of practicing eightfold <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> is to control the mind in order to make it a friend in discharging the human mission. Unless the mind is controlled, the practice of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> (for show) is simply a waste of time. One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one''s mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Paramatma. Real <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practice entails meeting the Paramatma within the heart and then following His dictation. For one who takes to K???a consciousness directly, perfect surrender to the dictation of the Lord follows automatically.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="6" sloka="7">
    <p>
      Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone''s heart as Paramatma. When the mind is misled by the external, illusory energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one''s mind is controlled through one of the <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> systems, one should be considered to have already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one''s mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Paramatma, or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in K???a consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical <![CDATA[ <i>samadhi,</i>]]> or absorption in the Supreme.

A K???a conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of K???a, because he is satisfied with pure devotional service. By realized knowledge, one becomes perfect. By transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions, but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled, because he is surrendered to K???a. He is transcendental because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship. For him mundane scholarship and mental speculation, which may be as good as gold to others, are of no greater value than pebbles or stones.

      K???a is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Paramatma and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K???a consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially K???a conscious, because the impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K???a and the Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K???a. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K???a conscious. A directly K???a conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman and Paramatma. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> are imperfectly K???a conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on K???a. One should always think of K???a and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called <![CDATA[ <i>samadhi,</i>]]> or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.
    </p>
    <p>All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in K???a consciousness, because direct K???a consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. Srila Rupa Gosvami characterizes K???a consciousness in this way:</p>
    <p>
      anasaktasya vi?ayan<br/>
      yatharham upayuñjata?<br/>
      nirbandha? k???a-sambandhe<br/>
      yukta? vairagyam ucyate
    </p>
    <p>
      prapañcikataya buddhya<br/>
      hari-sambandhi-vastuna?<br/>
      mumuk?ubhi? parityago<br/>
      vairagya? phalgu kathyate
    </p>
    <p>
      "When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K???a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to K???a is not as complete in his renunciation." (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhakti-rasam?ta-sindhu</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.2.255-256)<p></p>
        <p>
          A K???a conscious person well knows that everything belongs to K???a, and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept things in favor of K???a consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to K???a consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons not in K???a consciousness. Therefore a person in K???a consciousness is the perfect <![CDATA[ <i>yogi.</i>]]>

    </p>

  <slokas chapter="6" sloka="15">

      The ultimate goal in practicing <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> is now clearly explained. <![CDATA[ <i>Yoga</i>]]> practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> according to <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> Nor does cessation of material existence entail one''s entering into "the void," which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> as that place where there is no need of sun, moon or electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called <![CDATA[ <i>para? dhama,</i>]]> or superior abodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A consummate <![CDATA[ <i>yogi,</i>]]> who is perfect in understanding Lord K???a, as is clearly stated herein by the Lord Himself (<![CDATA[ <i><it>mat-citta?, mat-para?, mat-sthanam</it></i>]]><it>), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, K???aloka, known as Goloka V?ndavana. In the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.37) it is clearly stated, <![CDATA[ <i>goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhuta?:</i>]]> the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Paramatma as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky (Vaiku??ha) or enter into the Lord''s eternal abode (Goloka V?ndavana) without the proper understanding of K???a and His plenary expansion Vi??u.

      Regulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the <![CDATA[ <i>yogis.</i>]]> Too much eating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together. There is no need for men to eat animals, because there is an ample supply of grains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking, smoking and eating food which is not first offered to K???a will suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things. <![CDATA[ <i><it>Bhuñjate te tv agha? papa ye pacanty atma-kara?at<it>.</it></it></i>]]> Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his food to K???a, eats only sin.

A person in K???a consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to K???a. Therefore, only the K???a conscious person can attain perfection in <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practice <![CDATA[ <i>yoga.</i>]]> The K???a conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to perform <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practice. One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal.

      Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and mating—which are demands of the body—can block advancement in the practice of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga.</i>]]> As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept <![CDATA[ <i>prasadam,</i>]]> sanctified food. Lord K???a is offered, according to the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in K???a consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a K???a conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in K???a consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. <![CDATA[ <i>Avyartha-kalatvam:<it->
      [<it>Cc. </it></it-></i>]]><it>Madhya <it>23.18-19] a K???a conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect is Srila Rupa Gosvami, who was always engaged in the service of K???a and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that. ?hakura Haridasa would not even accept <![CDATA[ <i>prasadam</i>]]> nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a K???a conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with K???a''s interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in K???a consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him. <p></p></it></it></bd>

          "King Ambari?a first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord K???a; then, one after another, he engaged his words in describing the transcendental qualities of the Lord, his hands in mopping the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing of the activities of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the transcendental forms of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the devotees, his sense of smell in smelling the scents of the lotus flowers offered to the Lord, his tongue in tasting the <![CDATA[ <i>tulasi</i>]]> leaf offered at the lotus feet of the Lord, his legs in going to places of pilgrimage and the temple of the Lord, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in executing the mission of the Lord. All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a pure devotee."
        </p>
        <p>
          This transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in K???a consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the engagements of Maharaja Ambari?a. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are called <![CDATA[ <i>arcana,</i>]]> or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in general—especially those who are not in the renounced order of life—transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called <![CDATA[ <i>yukta</i>]]> in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]>

    <p>The <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practitioner should be determined and should patiently prosecute the practice without deviation.

(<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Upadesam?ta</bd-></i>]]><bd>3)<p></p>
        <p>As for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her eggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garu?a, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi??u, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garu?a was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garu?a at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garu?a.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the practice of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga,</i>]]> especially <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> in K???a consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job.

The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul.

In the <![CDATA[ <i>sm?ti</i>]]> (<it>S<it><![CDATA[ <i>a<it></it></i>]]>tvata-tantra<it>3.49) this is confirmed as follows: <it>
          <![CDATA[ <i>atatatvac ca mat?tvac ca atma hi paramo hari?<it>.</it></i>]]> The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer. As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the supreme father (or mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.<p></p>
          <p>Outwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two energies—the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord''s energy. Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another.
                    <p>
                      The <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while in the spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the living entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in K???a consciousness.

      A person in K???a consciousness certainly sees Lord K???a everywhere, and he sees everything in K???a. Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of K???a, knowing that everything is a manifestation of K???a''s energy. Nothing can exist without K???a, and K???a is the Lord of everything—this is the basic principle of K???a consciousness. K???a consciousness is the development of love of K???a—a position transcendental even to material liberation. At this stage of K???a consciousness, beyond self-realization, the devotee becomes one with K???a in the sense that K???a becomes everything for the devotee and the devotee becomes full in loving K???a. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In that stage, the living entity can never be annihilated, nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in K???a is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.38):<p></p>
        <p>
          premañjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena<br/>

        <p>
          At this stage, Lord K???a never disappears from the sight of the devotee, nor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the case of a <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> who sees the Lord as Paramatma within the heart, the same applies. Such a <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> turns into a pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment without seeing the Lord within himself.

The <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> should know that Vi??u is not different from K???a. K???a in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone''s heart. Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living entities. Nor is there a difference between a K???a conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of K???a and a perfect <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> engaged in meditation on the Supersoul. The <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> in K???a consciousness—even though he may be engaged in various activities while in material existence—remains always situated in K???a.

The perfect <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with K???a. And because one in K???a consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of K???a everywhere. Since the perfect <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> tries to broadcast the importance of becoming K???a conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. <![CDATA[ <i>Na ca tasman manu?ye?u kascin me priya-k?ttama?</i>]]> (<it>Bg.<it>18.69).

      The mind is so strong and obstinate that it sometimes overcomes the intelligence, although the mind is supposed to be subservient to the intelligence.

      The difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, is accepted by the Personality of Godhead. But at the same time He suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present age no one can observe the strict rules and regulations of placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of K???a consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about K???a. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears about K???a, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from K???a. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn <![CDATA[ <i>vairagya.</i>]]> <![CDATA[ <i>Vairagya</i>]]> means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of K???a. This is practical because by hearing about K???a one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called <![CDATA[ <i>paresanubhuti,</i>]]> spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction and strength. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord K???a is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered to K???a is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the process of K???a consciousness.

      The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> while engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it. <![CDATA[ <i>Yoga</i>]]> practice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, one must control the mind by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless one is engaged in K???a consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A K???a conscious person easily achieves the result of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practice without separate endeavor, but a <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practitioner cannot achieve success without becoming K???a conscious.

      The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice of the eightfold system or by <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga.</i>]]> In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of K???a consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the path of <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord K???a to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor one may fail, for many reasons. First of all, one may not be sufficiently serious about following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called <![CDATA[ <i>yogac calita-manasa?:</i>]]> deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.

      There are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no interest in transcendence; therefore they are more interested in material advancement by economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work. When one takes to the path of transcendence, one has to cease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material happiness. If the aspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both ways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one. But if it cannot join a big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky. The <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a? pathi</i>]]> is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, who is manifested as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. Lord Sri K???a is the fullest manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the Supreme Person is a successful transcendentalist. To reach this goal of life through Brahman and Paramatma realization takes many, many births (<![CDATA[ <i>bahuna? janmanam ante <it->[<it>Bg.<it-> </it-></it></it-></i>]]><it>7.19]). Therefore the supermost path of transcendental realization is <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> or K???a consciousness, the direct method. <p></p>

      K???a is the perfect knower of past, present and future. In the beginning of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> the Lord said that all living entities existed individually in the past, they exist now in the present, and they continue to retain individual identity in the future, even after liberation from the material entanglement. So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know of the future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist. No one is equal to or above K???a, and certainly the so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material nature cannot equal Him. Therefore the verdict of K???a is the final and complete answer to all doubts, because He knows past, present and future perfectly—but no one knows Him. K???a and K???a conscious devotees alone can know what is what.

      In the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.5.17) Sri Narada Muni instructs Vyasadeva as follows:<p></p>

          bhajann apakvo ''tha patet tato yadi<br/>

          "If someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way. On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything." For material prospects there are many activities, both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K???a consciousness. One may argue that by K???a consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavatam</i>]]> assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction for not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious K???a consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K???a consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>The purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually to K???a consciousness, certainly progress in life.</p>
        <p>
          Those who are following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to find ultimate liberation from material existence, and (3) those who are devotees in K???a consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification. Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life—even to the higher planets—but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in K???a consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of K???a consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity. And because the eightfold <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> system is directed toward the ultimate realization of K???a consciousness, such practice is also auspicious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.

      Birth in a family of <![CDATA[ <i>yogis</i>]]> or transcendentalists—those with great wisdom—is praised herein because the child born in such a family receives a spiritual impetus from the very beginning of his life. It is especially the case in the <![CDATA[ <i>acarya</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>gosvami</i>]]> families. Such families are very learned and devoted by tradition and training, and thus they become spiritual masters. In India there are many such <![CDATA[ <i>acarya</i>]]> families, but they have now degenerated due to insufficient education and training. By the grace of the Lord, there are still families that foster transcendentalists generation after generation. It is certainly very fortunate to take birth in such families. Fortunately, both our spiritual master, O?

      When we speak of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> we refer to linking our consciousness with the Supreme Absolute Truth.

The Lord has confirmed herein the superiority of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga,</i>]]> but He has not mentioned that it is better than <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga.</i>]]> <![CDATA[ <i>Bhakti-yoga</i>]]> is full spiritual knowledge, and therefore nothing can excel it.

      The word <![CDATA[ <i>bhajate</i>]]> is significant here. <![CDATA[ <i>Bhajate</i>]]> has its root in the verb <![CDATA[ <i>bhaj,</i>]]> which is used when there is need of service. The English word "worship" cannot be used in the same sense as <![CDATA[ <i>bhaj.</i>]]> Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(11.5.3) confirms this as follows:<p></p>
        <p>
          ya e?a? puru?a? sak?ad<br/>

        <p>"Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position."</p>
        <p>
          In this verse also the word <![CDATA[ <i>bhajanti</i>]]> is used. Therefore, <![CDATA[ <i>bhajanti</i>]]> is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word "worship" can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word <![CDATA[ <i>avajananti,</i>]]> used in this verse of <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i>]]> is also found in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> <![CDATA[ <i>Avajananti ma? mu?ha?<it->:<it><it->[<it>Bg.<it-> </it-></it></it-></it></it-></i>]]><it>9.11<![CDATA[ <i><it->]</it-></i>]]><it>

Factually, <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> is the ultimate goal, but to analyze <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> minutely one has to understand these other <![CDATA[ <i>yogas.</i>]]> The <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yogi, jñana-yogi</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>dhyana-yogi, raja-yogi, ha?ha-yogi,</i>]]> etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other <![CDATA[ <i>yogas.</i>]]> Therefore, to become K???a conscious is the highest stage of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga,</i>]]> just as, when we speak of Himalayan, we refer to the world''s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.

      In the first six chapters of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of <![CDATA[ <i>yogas.</i>]]> At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K???a, or in other words K???a consciousness, is the highest form of all <![CDATA[ <i>yoga.</i>]]> By concentrating one''s mind upon K???a, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> or localized Paramatma realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge is K???a, and everything is revealed to the person in K???a consciousness. In complete K???a consciousness one knows that K???a is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> are only steppingstones on the path of K???a consciousness. One who takes directly to K???a consciousness automatically knows about <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> and Paramatma in full. By practice of K???a consciousness <![CDATA[ <i>yoga,</i>]]> one can know everything in full—namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.
    </p>
    <p>
      One should therefore begin <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K???a the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which <![CDATA[ <i>srava?am</i>]]> is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, <![CDATA[ <i>tac ch??u,</i>]]> or "Hear from Me." No one can be a greater authority than K???a, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to become a perfectly K???a conscious person. One has therefore to learn from K???a directly or from a pure devotee of K???a—and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> this process of understanding K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:

    <p>
      "To hear about K???a from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about K???a, Lord K???a, who is dwelling in everyone''s heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about K???a from the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavatam</i>]]> and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of <![CDATA[ <i>asa?saya?-samagram,</i>]]> understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead." (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->SB</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.2.17-21)<p></p>
        <p>Therefore only by hearing from K???a or from His devotee in K???a consciousness can one understand the science of K???a. </p>

    <p>
      Complete knowledge includes knowledge of the phenomenal world, the spirit behind it, and the source of both of them. This is transcendental knowledge. The Lord wants to explain the above-mentioned system of knowledge because Arjuna is K???a''s confidential devotee and friend. In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter this explanation was given by the Lord, and it is again confirmed here: complete knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord in disciplic succession directly from the Lord. Therefore one should be intelligent enough to know the source of all knowledge, who is the cause of all causes and the only object for meditation in all types of <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practice. When the cause of all causes becomes known, then everything knowable becomes known, and nothing remains unknown. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Mu??aka Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.1.3) say, <it>kasminn u bhagavo vijñate sarvam ida? vijñata? bhavatiti<![CDATA[ <i><it>.</it></i>]]></it></bd>

      There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands, one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by <![CDATA[ <i>jñana-yoga, dhyana-yoga</i>]]> and discrimination of the self from matter. However, K???a can be known only by persons who are in K???a consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding K???a. K???a is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Paramatma. The <![CDATA[ <i>yogis</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>jñanis</i>]]> are confused in their attempts to understand K???a. Although the greatest of the impersonalists, Sripada Sa?karacarya, has admitted in his <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> commentary that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his followers do not accept K???a as such, for it is very difficult to know K???a, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.
    </p>
    <p>
      K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. <![CDATA[ <i><it>Isvara? parama? k???a? sac-cid-ananda-vigraha?/ anadir adir govinda? sarva-kara?a-kara?am<it>.</it></it></i>]]><it>
        <it>
          It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti,</i>]]> or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti</i>]]> is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti</i>]]> is not easy. The so-called path of <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti</i>]]> practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti</i>]]> may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. Srila Rupa Gosvami writes in his <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhakti-rasam?ta-sindhu</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.2.101):<p></p>
            <p>
              sruti-sm?ti-pura?adi-<br/>
              pañcaratra-vidhi? vina<br/>

              utpatayaiva kalpate
            </p>
            <p>
              "Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the <![CDATA[ <i>Upani?ads, Pura?as</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>Narada Pañcaratra</i>]]> is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society."
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not possible for the Brahman-realized impersonalist or the Paramatma-realized <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> to understand K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Yasoda or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about K???a (<![CDATA[ <i>muhyanti yat suraya?</i>]]>). <![CDATA[ <i><it>Ma? tu veda na kascana<it->:</it-></it></i>]]><it>
                "No one knows Me as I am," the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then <![CDATA[ <i><it>sa mahatma su-durlabha?<it>.</it></it></i>]]><it><it>"Such a great soul is very rare." Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one cannot know K???a as He is (<![CDATA[ <i>tattvata?</i>]]>), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in K???a—His being the cause of all causes, His omnipotence and opulence, and His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation—because K???a is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:<p></p>

      The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse energies. Material nature is called <![CDATA[ <i>prak?ti,</i>]]> or the energy of the Lord in His different <![CDATA[ <i>puru?a</i>]]> incarnations (expansions) as described in the Narada-pancaratra, one of the <![CDATA[ <i>Satvata-tantras:</i>]]>
    </p>

      "For material creation, Lord K???a''s plenary expansion assumes three Vi??us. The first one, Maha-vi??u, creates the total material energy, known as the <![CDATA[ <i>mahat-tattva.</i>]]> The second, Garbhodakasayi Vi??u, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, K?irodakasayi Vi??u, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Paramatma. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi??us can be liberated from material entanglement."
    </p>
    <p>
      This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Vi??u expansions of Lord K???a. These <![CDATA[ <i>puru?as</i>]]> are called incarnations. Generally one who does not know the science of God (K???a) assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the <![CDATA[ <i>puru?as</i>]]>—the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion it is stated that K???a is the original cause of the material manifestation. <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> also confirms this. The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir,</i>]]> which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> as there are in the Vaiku??halokas, and the impersonalist accepts this <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> as the ultimate eternal goal. The Paramatma manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the K?irodakasayi Vi??u. The Paramatma manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead K???a. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, K???a. The false ego—"I am," and "It is mine," which constitute the basic principle of material existence—includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the <![CDATA[ <i>mahat-tattva.</i>]]> Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of Sa?khya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from K???a''s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic Sa?khya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know K???a as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the Sa?khya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of K???a, as it is described in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]>
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="7" sloka="5">
    <p>
      Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are always controlled by the energetic, and therefore the living entities are always controlled by the Lord—they have no independent existence. They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described in <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(10.87.30) as follows:<p></p>
        <p>
          aparimita dhruvas tanu-bh?to yadi sarva-gatas<br/>
          tarhi na sasyateti niyamo dhruva netaratha<br/>
          ajani ca yan-maya? tad avimucya niyant? bhavet<br/>
          samam anujanata? yad amata? mata-du??ataya
        </p>
        <p>"O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers. Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by a faulty and polluted opinion."</p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Lord, K???a, is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called <![CDATA[ <i>mukti,</i>]]> or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material illusion, thinks, "I am matter, and material acquisitions are mine." His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may conclude that the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi-energies of K???a; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully K???a conscious, or liberated.

      </bd>

  <slokas chapter="7" sloka="6">
    <p>
      Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic field of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a certain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is developed because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because that superior energy, spirit soul, is present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of the presence of the Supersoul, Vi??u. Therefore spirit and matter, which combine to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely the living entity, may be the cause of a big skyscraper, a big factory, or even a big city, but he cannot be the cause of a big universe. The cause of the big universe is the big soul, or the Supersoul. And K???a, the Supreme, is the cause of both the big and small souls. Therefore He is the original cause of all causes. This is confirmed in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Ka?ha Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.2.13). <![CDATA[ <i>Nityo nityana? cetanas cetananam.</i>]]> <p></p></bd>

    <p>
      There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal. As far as <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a, and this is confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the <![CDATA[ <i>Brahma-sa?hita:</i>]]> <![CDATA[ <i><it>isvara? parama? k???a? sac-cid-ananda-vigraha?<it>;</it></it></i>]]><it><it>that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord K???a, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(3.10): <![CDATA[ <i>tato yad uttaratara? tad arupam anamayam/ ya etad vidur am?tas te bhavanti athetare du?kham evapiyanti.</i>]]> "In the material world Brahma, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahma there is the Transcendence, who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world."<p></p>
            <p>
              The impersonalist puts more stress on the word <![CDATA[ <i>arupam.</i>]]> But this <![CDATA[ <i>arupam</i>]]> is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the <![CDATA[ <i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> quoted above. Other verses in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(3.8-9) substantiate this as follows:<p></p>

                <p>From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material and spiritual. </p>

      This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, so the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water, because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying tasty water to quench man''s thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: <![CDATA[ <i>acintya bheda-</i>]]><it>and-<![CDATA[ <i><it>abheda-tattva</it></i>]]>—simultaneous oneness and difference.<p></p>
        <p>
          The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir,</i>]]> which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. And <![CDATA[ <i>pra?ava,</i>]]> or the <![CDATA[ <i>o?kara</i>]]> transcendental sound in the beginning of every Vedic hymn, addresses the Supreme Lord. Because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord K???a by His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound <![CDATA[ <i>o?kara.</i>]]> But they do not realize that <![CDATA[ <i>o?kara</i>]]> is the sound representation of K???a. The jurisdiction of K???a consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows K???a consciousness is blessed. Those who do not know K???a are in illusion, and so knowledge of K???a is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage.

Everything in the material world has a certain flavor or fragrance, as the flavor and fragrance in a flower, or in the earth, in water, in fire, in air, etc. The uncontaminated flavor, the original flavor, which permeates everything, is K???a. Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the mixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance, and some taste. <![CDATA[ <i>Vibhavasu</i>]]> means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot cook, etc., and that fire is K???a. The heat in the fire is K???a. According to Vedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even for digestion fire is needed. In K???a consciousness we become aware that earth, water, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material elements are due to K???a. The duration of man''s life is also due to K???a. Therefore by the grace of K???a, man can prolong his life or diminish it. So K???a consciousness is active in every sphere.

      <![CDATA[ <i>Bijam</i>]]> means seed; K???a is the seed of everything. There are various living entities, movable and inert. Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving living entities; trees and plants, however, are inert—they cannot move, but only stand. Every entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 species of life; some of them are moving and some of them are inert. In all cases, however, the seed of their life is K???a. As stated in Vedic literature, Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute Truth, is that from which everything is emanating. K???a is Para-brahman, the Supreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal and Para-brahman is personal. Impersonal Brahman is situated in the personal aspect—that is stated in <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> Therefore, originally, K???a is the source of everything. He is the root. As the root of a tree maintains the whole tree, K???a, being the original root of all things, maintains everything in this material manifestation. This is also confirmed in the Vedic literature (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Ka?ha Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>2.2.13):<p></p>
        <p>
          nityo nityana? cetanas cetananam<br/>
          eko bahuna? yo vidadhati kaman
        </p>
        <p>He is the prime eternal among all eternals. He is the supreme living entity of all living entities, and He alone is maintaining all life. One cannot do anything without intelligence, and K???a also says that He is the root of all intelligence. Unless a person is intelligent he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. </p>

      The strong man''s strength should be applied to protect the weak, not for personal aggression. Similarly, sex life, according to religious principles (<![CDATA[ <i>dharma</i>]]>), should be for the propagation of children, not otherwise. The responsibility of parents is then to make their offspring K???a conscious.

    <p>
      All material activities in the world are being conducted under the three modes of material nature. Although these material modes of nature are emanations from the Supreme Lord, K???a, He is not subject to them. For instance, under the state laws one may be punished, but the king, the lawmaker, is not subject to that law. Similarly, all the modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—are emanations from the Supreme Lord, K???a, but K???a is not subject to material nature. Therefore He is <![CDATA[ <i>nirgu?a,</i>]]> which means that these <![CDATA[ <i>gu?as,</i>]]> or modes, although issuing from Him, do not affect Him. That is one of the special characteristics of Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="7" sloka="13">
    <p>The whole world is enchanted by the three modes of material nature. Those who are bewildered by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this material nature is the Supreme Lord, K???a.</p>
    <p>
      Every living entity under the influence of material nature has a particular type of body and a particular type of psychological and biological activities accordingly. There are four classes of men functioning in the three material modes of nature. Those who are purely in the mode of goodness are called <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?as.</i>]]> Those who are purely in the mode of passion are called <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriyas.</i>]]> Those who are in the modes of both passion and ignorance are called <![CDATA[ <i>vaisyas.</i>]]> Those who are completely in ignorance are called <![CDATA[ <i>sudras.</i>]]> And those who are less than that are animals or animal life. However, these designations are not permanent. I may either be a <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a, k?atriya,</i>]]> <![CDATA[ <i>vaisya</i>]]> or whatever-in any case, this life is temporary. But although life is temporary and we do not know what we are going to be in the next life, by the spell of this illusory energy we consider ourselves in terms of this bodily conception of life, and we thus think that we are American, Indian, Russian, or <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a.</i>]]> Hindu, Muslim, etc. And if we become entangled with the modes of material nature, then we forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is behind all these modes. So Lord K???a says that living entities deluded by these three modes of nature do not understand that behind the material background is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
    </p>
    <p>There are many different kinds of living entities—human beings, demigods, animals, etc.—and each and every one of them is under the influence of material nature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality of Godhead. Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and even those who are in the mode of goodness, cannot go beyond the impersonal Brahman conception of the Absolute Truth. They are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal feature, which possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and renunciation. When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope is there for those in passion and ignorance? K???a consciousness is transcendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are truly established in K???a consciousness are actually liberated. </p>

    <p>
      The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called <![CDATA[ <i>nitya-baddha,</i>]]> or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> confirm this as follows: <![CDATA[ <i>maya? tu prak?ti? vidyan mayina? tu mahesvaram.</i>]]> "Although <![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]> [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of <![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]> is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahesvara, the supreme controller." (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>4.10)<p></p>
        <p>
          Another meaning of <![CDATA[ <i>gu?a</i>]]> is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself—he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord K???a, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or K???a consciousness, can help one gain such release. K???a, being the Lord of the illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity, who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words <![CDATA[ <i>mam eva</i>]]> are also significant. <![CDATA[ <i>Mam</i>]]> means unto K???a (Vi??u) only, and not Brahma or Siva. Although Brahma and Siva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Vi??u, it is not possible for such incarnations of <![CDATA[ <i>rajo-gu?a</i>]]> (passion) and <![CDATA[ <i>tamo-gu?a</i>]]> (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of <![CDATA[ <i>maya.</i>]]> In other words, both Brahma and Siva are also under the influence of <![CDATA[ <i>maya.</i>]]> Only Vi??u is the master of <![CDATA[ <i>maya;</i>]]> therefore He alone can give release to the conditioned soul. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>3.8) confirm this in the phrase <![CDATA[ <i>tam eva viditva,</i>]]> or "Freedom is possible only by understanding K???a." Even Lord Siva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vi??u. Lord Siva says, <![CDATA[ <i>mukti-pradata sarve?a? vi??ur eva na sa?saya?:</i>]]> "There is no doubt that Vi??u is the deliverer of liberation for everyone." <p></p></bd>

    <p>
      It is said in <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality K???a one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of Sri K???a, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? <![CDATA[ <i>Mukti,</i>]]> or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don''t these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method?
    </p>
    <p>
      The <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like Brahma, Siva, Kapila, the Kumaras, Manu, Vyasa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, Prahlada, Bali, and later on Madhvacarya, Ramanujacarya, Sri Caitanya and many others—who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc.—surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of "planning commissions."
    </p>
    <p>
      The atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word <![CDATA[ <i>du?k?tina?,</i>]]> or "miscreants." <![CDATA[ <i>K?ti</i>]]> means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist''s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called <![CDATA[ <i>du?k?ti,</i>]]> which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hira?yakasipu and Rava?a, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These <![CDATA[ <i>du?k?tinas,</i>]]> or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <bd>
        (1) <bd>The <![CDATA[ <i>mu?has</i>]]> are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not know that <![CDATA[ <i>karma</i>]]> (action) is meant for <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> (sacrifice).<p>
            <p>
              Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To such <![CDATA[ <i>mu?has,</i>]]> material gains, which are destructible, are life''s all in all-despite the fact that the <![CDATA[ <i>mu?has</i>]]> enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane world, but will have very little time to hear about the eternal living force that moves the material world.
            </p>
            <p>
              <bd>
                (2)<bd>Another class of <![CDATA[ <i>du?k?ti,</i>]]> or miscreant, is called the <![CDATA[ <i>naradhama,</i>]]> or the lowest of mankind. <![CDATA[ <i>Nara</i>]]> means human being, and <![CDATA[ <i>adhama</i>]]> means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulative principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be considered <![CDATA[ <i>naradhamas.</i>]]> Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man''s relation with Him. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant for man''s <![CDATA[ <i>reviving the lost consciousness</i>]]> of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead Sri K???a, who is all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a <![CDATA[ <i>naradhama.</i>]]> We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother''s womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by <![CDATA[ <i>maya,</i>]]> the illusory energy.<p>
                    <p>
                      It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the <![CDATA[ <i>Manu-sm?ti,</i>]]> which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of <![CDATA[ <i>var?asrama.</i>]]> However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is <![CDATA[ <i>naradhama.</i>]]>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When the whole population becomes <![CDATA[ <i>naradhama,</i>]]> naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature. According to the standard of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita,</i>]]> a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?a,</i>]]> the dog. the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. Sri Nityananda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical <![CDATA[ <i>naradhamas,</i>]]> the brothers Jagai and Madhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the <![CDATA[ <i>naradhama</i>]]> who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the <![CDATA[ <i>bhagavata-dharma,</i>]]> or activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message is <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even refuse to give an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? <![CDATA[ <i>Naradhamas,</i>]]> or the lowest of mankind, willfully neglect the prime duty of the human being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <bd>
                        (3) <bd>The next class of <![CDATA[ <i>du?k?ti</i>]]> is called <![CDATA[ <i>mayayapah?ta-jñana?,</i>]]> or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows—great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.—but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.<p></p>
                          <p>
                            There are a great number of <![CDATA[ <i>mayayapah?ta-jñana?</i>]]> at the present moment, even amongst the scholars of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> In the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita,</i>]]> in plain and simple language, it is stated that Sri K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of Brahma, the original father of all human beings. In fact, Sri K???a is said to be not only the father of Brahma but also the father of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Paramatma; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the <![CDATA[ <i>mayayapah?ta-jñana?</i>]]> deride the personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            All the unauthorized interpretations of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> by the class of <![CDATA[ <i>mayayapah?ta-jñana?,</i>]]> outside the purview of the <![CDATA[ <i>parampara</i>]]> system, are so many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri K???a, nor do they teach others to follow this principle.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <bd>
                              (4) <bd>The last class of <![CDATA[ <i>du?k?ti</i>]]> is called <![CDATA[ <i>asura? bhavam asrita?,</i>]]> or those of demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita.</i>]]> Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such persons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead, cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri K???a.<p></p>
                                <p>Sri Yamunacarya Albandaru of South India said, "O my Lord! You are unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Your uncommon qualities, features and activities, despite Your personality''s being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities."</p>
                                <p>Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice. </p>

      Unlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the scriptures, and they are called <![CDATA[ <i>suk?tina?,</i>]]> or those who obey the rules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of men—those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees, because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit. The <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhakti-rasam?ta-sindhu</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.1.11) defines pure devotion thus:<p></p>
        <p>
          anyabhila?ita-sunya?<br/>
          jñana-karmady-anav?tam<br/>

                  <p>
                    <p>"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K???a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service."</p>
                    <p>When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.</p>
                    <p>Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, the search for mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service. </p>

    <p>Free from all contaminations of material desires, the distressed, the inquisitive, the penniless and the seeker after supreme knowledge can all become pure devotees. But out of them, he who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a really pure devotee of the Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is in full knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional service is, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his material body, and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma. When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutional position is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association with pure devotees the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker after material amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge of the Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional service is very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected in devotional service that material contamination cannot touch him. </p>

    <p>
      It is not that devotees who are less complete in knowledge are not dear to the Lord. The Lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a <![CDATA[ <i>mahatma,</i>]]> or great soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotional service are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange of affection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some material benefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they also advance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge is considered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is to serve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannot live a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot be separated from him.

      In the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(9.4.68), the Lord says:<p></p>

    <p>The living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one''s attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord Sri K???a''s mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes, and that this material manifestation is not independent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K???a. Thus he thinks of everything in relation to Vasudeva, or Sri K???a. Such a universal vision of Vasudeva precipitates one''s full surrender to the Supreme Lord Sri K???a as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.</p>

Similarly Lord Vasudeva, or the Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri K???a, is the prime entity in everything. And because Vasudeva is all-pervading and everything is Vasudeva, the devotee surrenders in full knowledge (cf. <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> 7.17 and 11.40). <p></p>

      Those who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the Supreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as the material contamination is not completely washed off, they are by nature nondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort to the Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; because of approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all material lust. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> it is recommended that whether one is a pure devotee and is free from all material desires, or is full of material desires, or desires liberation from material contamination, he should in all cases surrender to Vasudeva and worship Him. As stated in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.3.10):<p></p>

          Less intelligent people who have lost their spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in the lower modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship various demigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord K???a is the master of all. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Caitanya-caritam?ta</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Adi</bd-></i>]]><bd>5.142) it is said, <![CDATA[ <i>ekale isvara k???a, ara saba bh?tya:</i>]]> only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, is master, and all others are servants. Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He gives. <p></p></bd>

    <p>
      God has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone''s heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full independence—whatever one likes—but His ultimate instruction we find in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita:</i>]]> one should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wife of Lord Siva. In this way there are recommendations in the <![CDATA[ <i>sastras</i>]]> (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of all living entities, K???a gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In the Vedic literature it is stated: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the supreme will. They are not independent."
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="7" sloka="22">
    <p>
      The demigods cannot award benedictions to their devotees without the permission of the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget that everything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired results are due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the <![CDATA[ <i><it>Caitanya-caritam?ta</it></i>]]> <it>it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional service to the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform, because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.<p></p>
        <p>For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent living entities, who therefore prefer to worship demigods of the material world rather than engage in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. </p>
      </it>
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="7" sloka="23">
    <p>
      Some commentators on the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> say that one who worships a demigod can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god''s planet. It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.
    </p>
    <p>Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they don''t know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food. This isn''t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.</p>
    <p>
      Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities are also. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> it is stated that the <![CDATA[ <i>brahma?as</i>]]> are the head of the Supreme Lord, the <![CDATA[ <i>k?atriyas</i>]]> are His arms, the <![CDATA[ <i>vaisyas</i>]]> are His waist, the <![CDATA[ <i>sudras</i>]]> are His legs, and all serve different functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and he himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.
    </p>
    <p>The results achieved by the demigods'' benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee engaged in K???a consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited. </p>

    <p>Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord K???a in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yamunacarya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession of Ramanujacarya, has written a very appropriate verse in this connection. He says,</p>
    <p>

      "My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing <![CDATA[ <i>Vedanta</i>]]> and the <![CDATA[ <i>Upani?ads</i>]]> and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead." (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Stotra-ratna</bd-></i>]]><bd>12)
      <p>
          <p>
            In the <![CDATA[ <i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedanta</i>]]> literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only are the worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in <![CDATA[ <i>Vedanta</i>]]> and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true K???a consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God''s personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as <![CDATA[ <i>abuddhaya?,</i>]]> which means those who do not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul—but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor Sa?karacarya, who has specifically stated that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K???a to be only the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in the <![CDATA[ <i>
              <bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(9.11). <![CDATA[ <i>Avajananti ma? mu?ha manu?i? tanum asritam:</i>]]> "Only the fools regard Me as an ordinary person."<p></p>
              <p>
                The fact is that no one can understand K???a without rendering devotional service and without developing K???a consciousness. The <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(10.14.29) confirms this:<p></p>
                  <p>
                    athapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-<br/>

                    "My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> for many years." One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in K???a consciousness, beginning by chanting the <![CDATA[ <i>maha-mantra</i>]]>—Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare—then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that K???a has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything are <![CDATA[ <i>maya.</i>]]> These impersonalists are known as Mayavadis. They do not know the ultimate truth.

                  <p>
                    The twentieth verse clearly states, <![CDATA[ <i>

                      "Those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods." It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in the twenty-third verse, <![CDATA[ <i>
                        <it>

                          the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord K???a go to the K???aloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.<p></p>
                          <p>
                            Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed. From the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K???a is <![CDATA[ <i>sac-cid-ananda,</i>]]> eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedic literature confirms that the Supreme Absolute Truth is knowledge and blissful pleasure, <it>
                              vijñanam ananda? brahma<it>
                                (<it>B?had-ara?yaka Upani?ad<it>3.9.28), and that He is the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities, ananta-kalya?a-gu?atmako ''sau (<it>Vi??u Pura?a<it>6.5.84). And in the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> the Lord says that although He is <![CDATA[ <i>aja</i>]]> (unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> are concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K???a, has both form and personality. <p></p>

      It may be argued that since Krsna was visible to everyone when He was present on this earth, how can it be said that He is not manifest to everyone? But actually He was not manifest to everyone. When K???a was present there were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when Sisupala spoke against K???a''s being elected president of the assembly, Bhi?ma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pa??avas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> K???a says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His internal potency.

      Here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If K???a, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were <![CDATA[ <i>maya,</i>]]> material, as the impersonalists consider Him to be, then like the living entity He would change His body and forget everything about His past life. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord K???a clearly says that He completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K???a remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K???a knows every living entity because He is situated in every living being''s heart as the Supersoul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the less intelligent, even if able to realize the impersonal Brahman, cannot realize Sri K???a as the Supreme Person. Certainly the transcendental body of Sri K???a is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and <![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]> is like a cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly, <![CDATA[ <i>maya</i>]]> cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord K???a is. Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma, he cannot possibly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a, without being in K???a consciousness.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="7" sloka="27">
    <p>The real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one is deluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlled by the illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire and hate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become one with the Supreme Lord and envies K???a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure devotees, who are not deluded or contaminated by desire and hate, can understand that Lord Sri K???a appears by His internal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nescience think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by material energies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons, symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery and happiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc., thinking, "This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of this house; I am the husband of this wife." These are the dualities of delusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolish and therefore cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="7" sloka="28">
    <p>Those eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have acted piously, and who have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform. This elevation is possible in K???a consciousness in the association of pure devotees, for in the association of great devotees one can be delivered from delusion.</p>
    <p>
      It is stated in the <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.5.2) that if one actually wants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees (<![CDATA[ <i>mahat-seva? dvaram ahur vimukte?</i>]]>); but one who associates with materialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence (<![CDATA[ <i>tamo-dvara? yo?ita? sa?gi-sa?gam</i>]]>). All the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion. The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violation of God''s law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional position, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality or to be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service with determination. <p></p></bd>

      Birth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not the spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service is really liberated. <![CDATA[ <i>Aha? brahmasmi:</i>]]> I am spirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman, spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotional service, as described in this verse. The pure devotees are transcendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they know everything about transcendental activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully K???a conscious, they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. But those who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized persons cannot reach the supreme planet of K???a known as Goloka V?ndavana. Only persons who perform activities in K???a consciousness (<![CDATA[ <i>mam asritya</i>]]>) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they are actually endeavoring to reach the K???a planet. Such persons have no misgivings about K???a, and thus they are factually Brahman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or <![CDATA[ <i>arca</i>]]> of the Lord, or who are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation from material bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports of Brahman, <![CDATA[ <i>adhibhuta,</i>]]> etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="7" sloka="30">
    <p>Persons acting in K???a consciousness are never deviated from the path of entirely understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental association of K???a consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and at the time of death such a K???a conscious person can never forget K???a. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V?ndavana.</p>
    <p>This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K???a conscious person. The beginning of K???a consciousness is association of persons who are K???a conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K???a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K???a and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of K???a consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of K???a he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain K???a consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
    <p>Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K???a consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of K???a consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord K???a. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by his doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called <![CDATA[ <i>d??ha-vrata,</i>]]> and it is the beginning of <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is the substance of that conviction.</p>
    <p>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the Srimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute.</p>

      In this chapter Lord K???a answers different questions from Arjuna, beginning with "What is Brahman?" The Lord also explains <![CDATA[ <i>karma</i>]]> (fruitive activities), devotional service and <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> principles, and devotional service in its pure form. The <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> explains that the Supreme Absolute Truth is known as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. In addition, the living entity, the individual soul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires about <![CDATA[ <i>atma,</i>]]> which refers to body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic dictionary, <![CDATA[ <i>atma</i>]]> refers to the mind, soul, body and senses also.
    </p>
    <p>Arjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as Puru?ottama, Supreme Person, which means that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the Supreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive answers. </p>

      "Lord of sacrifice" may refer to either Indra or Vi??u. Vi??u is the chief of the primal demigods, including Brahma and Siva, and Indra is the chief of the administrative demigods. Both Indra and Vi??u are worshiped by <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> performances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of <![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]> (sacrifice) and how the Lord is residing within the body of the living entity.
    </p>
    <p>Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhusudana because K???a once killed a demon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna, because Arjuna is a K???a conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since K???a is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhusudana so that K???a might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna''s mind.</p>
    <p>
      Now the word <![CDATA[ <i>praya?a-kale</i>]]> in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna is very anxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in K???a consciousness. What should be their position at that final moment? At the time of death all the bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition. Thus disturbed by the bodily situation, one may not be able to remember the Supreme Lord. Maharaja Kulasekhara, a great devotee, prays, "My dear Lord, just now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the swan of my mind can seek entrance at the stem of Your lotus feet." The metaphor is used because the swan, a bird of the water, takes pleasure in digging into the lotus flowers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus flower. Maharaja Kulasekhara says to the Lord, "Now my mind is undisturbed, and I am quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am sure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But if I have to wait for my natural death, then I do not know what will happen, because at that time the bodily functions will be disrupted, my throat will be choked up, and I do not know whether I shall be able to chant Your name. Better let me die immediately." Arjuna questions how a person can fix his mind on K???a''s lotus feet at such a time.

      Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not changed at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Para-brahman. Brahman refers to the living entity, and Para-brahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual consciousness, K???a consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called <![CDATA[ <i>karma,</i>]]> or varied creation by the force of material consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Vedic literature the living entity is called <![CDATA[ <i>jivatma</i>]]> and Brahman, but he is never called Para-brahman. The living entity (<![CDATA[ <i>jivatma</i>]]>) takes different positions—sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior, spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord''s marginal energy. According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In material nature he is manifested sometimes as a man, demigod, animal, beast, bird, etc., according to his <![CDATA[ <i>karma.</i>]]> To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (<![CDATA[ <i>yajña</i>]]>), but when his merit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man. This process is called <![CDATA[ <i>karma.</i>]]>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <![CDATA[ <i>Chandogya Upani?ad</i>]]> describes the Vedic sacrificial process. On the sacrificial altar, five kinds of offerings are made into five kinds of fire. The five kinds of fire are conceived of as the heavenly planets, clouds, the earth, man and woman, and the five kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on the moon, rain, grains and semen.
    </p>
    <p>In the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit of sacrifice is exhausted, the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path. The K???a conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes directly to K???a consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead.</p>
    <p>
      Impersonalist commentators on the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> unreasonably assume that Brahman takes the form of <![CDATA[ <i>jiva</i>]]> in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita.</i>]]> But in this verse the Lord also speaks of the living entity as "an eternal fragment of Myself." The fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the form of <![CDATA[ <i>jiva</i>]]> is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Para-brahman (the Supreme Lord). <p></p>

      The physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration, they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical nature is called <![CDATA[ <i>adhibhuta.</i>]]> It is created at a certain point and will be annihilated at a certain point. The conception of the universal form of the Supreme Lord, which includes all the demigods and their different planets, is called <![CDATA[ <i>adhidaivata.</i>]]> And present in the body along with the individual soul is the Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord K???a. The Supersoul is called the Paramatma or <![CDATA[ <i>adhiyajña</i>]]> and is situated in the heart. The word <![CDATA[ <i>eva</i>]]> is particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the Paramatma is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul''s activities and is the source of the soul''s various types of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the individual soul an opportunity to act freely and witnesses his activities. The functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified for the pure K???a conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service to the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord called <![CDATA[ <i>adhidaivata</i>]]> is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form, or <![CDATA[ <i>vira?-puru?a,</i>]]> whose legs are considered the lower planets, whose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the upper planetary system.

      In this verse the importance of K???a consciousness is stressed. Anyone who quits his body in K???a consciousness is at once transferred to the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the purest of the pure. Therefore anyone who is constantly K???a conscious is also the purest of the pure. The word <![CDATA[ <i>smaran</i>]]> ("remembering") is important. Remembrance of K???a is not possible for the impure soul who has not practiced K???a consciousness in devotional service. Therefore one should practice K???a consciousness from the very beginning of life. If one wants to achieve success at the end of his life, the process of remembering K???a is essential. Therefore one should constantly, incessantly chant the <![CDATA[ <i>maha-mantra</i>]]>—Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Lord Caitanya has advised that one be as tolerant as a tree (<![CDATA[ <i>taror iva sahi??una</i>]]>). There may be so many impediments for a person who is chanting Hare K???a. Nonetheless, tolerating all these impediments, one should continue to chant Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, so that at the end of one''s life one can have the full benefit of K???a consciousness.

    <p>The process of changing one''s nature at the critical moment of death is here explained. A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking of K???a attains the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true that a person who thinks of something other than K???a attains the same transcendental state. This is a point we should note very carefully. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Maharaja Bharata, although a great personality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and so in his next life he was transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his past activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one''s thoughts during the course of one''s life accumulate to influence one''s thoughts at the moment of death, so this life creates one''s next life. If in one''s present life one lives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of K???a, it is possible for one to remember K???a at the end of one''s life. That will help one be transferred to the transcendental nature of K???a. If one is transcendentally absorbed in K???a''s service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not material. Therefore the chanting of Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare is the best process for successfully changing one''s state of being at the end of one''s life. </p>

    <p>This instruction to Arjuna is very important for all men engaged in material activities. The Lord does not say that one should give up his prescribed duties or engagements. One can continue them and at the same time think of K???a by chanting Hare K???a. This will free one from material contamination and engage the mind and intelligence in K???a. By chanting K???a''s names, one will be transferred to the supreme planet, K???aloka, without a doubt. </p>

      In this verse Lord K???a stresses the importance of remembering Him. One''s memory of K???a is revived by chanting the <![CDATA[ <i>maha-mantra,</i>]]> Hare K???a. By this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one''s ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very easy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. <![CDATA[ <i>Puru?am</i>]]> means enjoyer. Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary expansions as Naraya?a, Vasudeva, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devotee can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in any of His features—Naraya?a, K???a, Rama, etc.—by chanting Hare K???a. This practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant chanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. <![CDATA[ <i>Yoga</i>]]> practice is meditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare K???a one fixes his mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is fickle, and therefore it is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of K???a. One example often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is transformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly think of K???a, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same bodily constitution as K???a.

      The process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse. The foremost point is that He is not impersonal or void. One cannot meditate on something impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of K???a, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord is <![CDATA[ <i>puru?a,</i>]]> a person—we think of the person Rama and the person K???a. And whether one thinks of Rama or of K???a, what He is like is described in this verse of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The Lord is <![CDATA[ <i>kavi;</i>]]> that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, and He is the maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word <![CDATA[ <i>acintya</i>]]> ("inconceivable") is very significant in this connection. God''s energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (<![CDATA[ <i>acintya</i>]]>). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it. We cannot comprehend even this material world, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world—so how can we comprehend what is beyond? <![CDATA[ <i>Acintya</i>]]> means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas, Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> and follow the principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding.

      In this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be fixed in devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The practice of <![CDATA[ <i>?a?-cakra-yoga,</i>]]> involving meditation on the six <![CDATA[ <i>cakras,</i>]]> is suggested here.

      Lord Sri K???a has recommended to Arjuna the practice of <![CDATA[ <i>?a?-cakra-yoga,</i>]]> in which one places the air of life between the eyebrows. Taking it for granted that Arjuna might not know how to practice <![CDATA[ <i>?a?-cakra-yoga,</i>]]> the Lord explains the process in the following verses. The Lord says that Brahman, although one without a second, has various manifestations and features. Especially for the impersonalists, the <![CDATA[ <i>ak?ara,</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>o?kara</i>]]>—the syllable <![CDATA[ <i>o?</i>]]>—is identical with Brahman. K???a here explains the impersonal Brahman, into which the renounced order of sages enter.

    <p>
      In the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught to vibrate <![CDATA[ <i>o?</i>]]> and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman''s features. This practice is very essential for the student''s advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacari</i>]]> (unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one''s practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacari</i>]]> principles. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this Age of Kali, that in this age no process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy names of Lord K???a: Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

      To practice <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> as suggested here, one first has to close the doors of all sense enjoyment. This practice is called <![CDATA[ <i>pratyahara,</i>]]> or withdrawing the senses from the sense objects. The sense organs for acquiring knowledge—the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch—should be fully controlled and should not be allowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the Supersoul in the heart, and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In the Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before, this practice is not practical in this age. The best process is K???a consciousness. If one is always able to fix his mind on K???a in devotional service, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance, or in <![CDATA[ <i>samadhi.</i>]]>

      This verse especially describes the final destination attained by the unalloyed devotees who serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead in <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga.</i>]]> Previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of devotees—the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been described: <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yoga, jñana-yoga</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>ha?ha-yoga.</i>]]> The principles of these <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> systems have some <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti</i>]]> added, but this verse particularly mentions pure <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> without any mixture of <![CDATA[ <i>jñana, karma</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>ha?ha.</i>]]> As indicated by the word <![CDATA[ <i>ananya-ceta?,</i>]]> in pure <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> the devotee desires nothing but K???a. A pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with the <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> or salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Caitanya-caritam?ta</i>]]> the pure devotee is called <![CDATA[ <i>ni?kama,</i>]]> which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas a <![CDATA[ <i>jñana-yogi, karma-yogi</i>]]> or <![CDATA[ <i>ha?ha-yogi</i>]]> has his own selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pure devotee always engages in devotional service to K???a in one of His various personal features. K???a has various plenary expansions and incarnations, such as Rama and N?si?ha, and a devotee can choose to fix his mind in loving service to any of these transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other <![CDATA[ <i>yogas.</i>]]> <![CDATA[ <i>Bhakti-yoga</i>]]> is very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare K???a. The Lord is merciful to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those who always serve Him without deviation. The Lord helps such devotees in various ways. As stated in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Ka?ha Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.2.23), <![CDATA[ <i>yam evai?a v??ute tena labhyas/ tasyai?a atma viv??ute tanu? svam:</i>]]> one who is fully surrendered and engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can understand the Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(10.10), <![CDATA[ <i>dadami buddhi-yoga? tam:</i>]]> the Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.<p>
            <p>
              The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of K???a without deviation and without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like V?ndavana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of V?ndavana by his devotional service. It was Sri Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, "Wherever You are, O Lord-<![CDATA[ <i>there</i>]]> is V?ndavana."
            </p>
            <p>
              As indicated by the words <![CDATA[ <i>satatam</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>nityasa?,</i>]]> which mean "always," "regularly," or "every day," a pure devotee constantly remembers K???a and meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most easily attainable. <![CDATA[ <i>Bhakti-yoga</i>]]> is the system that the <![CDATA[ <i>Gita</i>]]> recommends above all others. Generally, the <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yogis</i>]]> are engaged in five different ways: (1) <![CDATA[ <i>santa-bhakta,</i>]]> engaged in devotional service in neutrality; (2) <![CDATA[ <i>dasya-bhakta,</i>]]> engaged in devotional service as servant; (3) <![CDATA[ <i>sakhya-bhakta,</i>]]> engaged as friend; (4) <![CDATA[ <i>vatsalya-bhakta,</i>]]> engaged as parent; and (5) <![CDATA[ <i>madhurya-bhakta,</i>]]> engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K???a conscious process of chanting the <![CDATA[ <i>maha-mantra</i>]]>—Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

      Since this temporary material world is full of the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death, naturally he who achieves the highest perfection and attains the supreme planet, K???aloka, Goloka V?ndavana, does not wish to return. The supreme planet is described in Vedic literature as <![CDATA[ <i>avyakta</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>ak?ara</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>parama gati;</i>]]> in other words, that planet is beyond our material vision, and it is inexplicable, but it is the highest goal, the destination for the <![CDATA[ <i>mahatmas</i>]]> (great souls). The <![CDATA[ <i>mahatmas</i>]]> receive transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in K???a consciousness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet. They only want K???a and K???a''s association, and nothing else. That is the highest perfection of life. This verse specifically mentions the personalist devotees of the Supreme Lord, K???a. These devotees in K???a consciousness achieve the highest perfection of life. In other words, they are the supreme souls.

      All kinds of <![CDATA[ <i>yogis-karma, jñana, ha?ha,</i>]]> etc.—eventually have to attain devotional perfection in <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> or K???a consciousness, before they can go to K???a''s transcendental abode and never return. Those who attain the highest material planets, the planets of the demigods, are again subjected to repeated birth and death. As persons on earth are elevated to higher planets, people on higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall down to earth. The practice of sacrifice called <![CDATA[ <i>pañcagni-vidya,</i>]]> recommended in the <![CDATA[ <i>Chandogya Upani?ad,</i>]]> enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, on Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate K???a consciousness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress in K???a consciousness on the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to the eternal spiritual kingdom. Baladeva Vidyabhu?a?a, in his commentary on <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> quotes this verse:
    </p>
    <p>
      brahma?a saha te sarve<br/>

      The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of <![CDATA[ <i>kalpas.</i>]]> A <![CDATA[ <i>kalpa</i>]]> is a day of Brahma, and one day of Brahma consists of a thousand cycles of four <![CDATA[ <i>yugas,</i>]]> or ages: Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali. The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the <![CDATA[ <i>yuga</i>]]> lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Treta-yuga vice is introduced, and this <![CDATA[ <i>yuga</i>]]> lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dvapara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this <![CDATA[ <i>yuga</i>]]> lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the <![CDATA[ <i>yuga</i>]]> we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this <![CDATA[ <i>yuga</i>]]> lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the <![CDATA[ <i>yuga</i>]]> the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki <![CDATA[ <i>avatara,</i>]]> vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four <![CDATA[ <i>yugas,</i>]]> rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahma, and the same number comprise one night. Brahma lives one hundred of such "years" and then dies. These "hundred years" by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 billion earth years. By these calculations the life of Brahma seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning flash. In the Causal Ocean there are innumerable Brahmas rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahma and his creation are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the material universe not even Brahma is free from the process of birth, old age, disease and death. Brahma, however, is directly engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord in the management of this universe—therefore he at once attains liberation. Elevated <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasis</i>]]> are promoted to Brahma''s particular planet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and which survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary system, but in due course Brahma and all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka are subject to death, according to the law of material nature.

      The less intelligent, who try to remain within this material world, may be elevated to higher planets and then again must come down to this planet earth. During the daytime of Brahma they can exhibit their activities on higher and lower planets within this material world, but at the coming of Brahma''s night they are all annihilated. In the day they receive various bodies for material activities, and at night they no longer have bodies but remain compact in the body of Vi??u. Then again they are manifest at the arrival of Brahma''s day. <![CDATA[ <i>

And when Brahma is born again in another millennium they are again manifest. In this way they are captivated by the spell of the material world. But those intelligent persons who take to K???a consciousness use the human life fully in the devotional service of the Lord, chanting Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Thus they transfer themselves, even in this life, to the spiritual planet of K???a and become eternally blissful there, not being subject to such rebirths. <p></p>

      The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, K???a, is described in the <![CDATA[ <i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> as <![CDATA[ <i><it>cintama?i-dhama<it>,</it></it></i>]]> a place where all desires are fulfilled. The supreme abode of Lord K???a, known as Goloka V?ndavana, is full of palaces made of touchstone. There are also trees, called "desire trees," that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows, known as <![CDATA[ <i>surabhi</i>]]> cows, which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak?mis), and He is called Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His flute <it>(<![CDATA[ <i>ve?u? kva?antam</i>]]><it>). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the worlds—His eyes are like lotus petals, and the color of His body is like the color of clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His hair. In the <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> Lord K???a gives only a small hint of His personal abode, Goloka V?ndavana, which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the <![CDATA[ <i>Brahma-sa?hita.</i>]]> Vedic literatures (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Ka?ha Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.3.11) state that there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination (<![CDATA[ <i>puru?an na para? kiñcit sa ka??ha parama gati?</i>]]>). When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. K???a''s supreme abode and K???a Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. On this earth, V?ndavana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka V?ndavana located in the spiritual sky. When K???a descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as V?ndavana, comprising about eighty-four square miles in the district of Mathura, India. <p></p></bd></it></it>

  <slokas chapter="8" sloka="22">
    <p>
      It is here clearly stated that the supreme destination, from which there is no return, is the abode of K???a, the Supreme Person. The <![CDATA[ <i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> describes this supreme abode as <![CDATA[ <i><it>ananda-cinmaya-rasa<it>,</it></it></i>]]> a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. All the variegatedness manifest there is of the quality of spiritual bliss—nothing there is material. That variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere—both in the material and in the spiritual universes. <![CDATA[ <i>Yasyanta?-sthani</i>]]> means that everything is sustained within Him, within either His spiritual or material energy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enter K???a''s supreme abode or the innumerable Vaiku??ha planets is possible only by <![CDATA[ <i>bhakti,</i>]]> devotional service, as clearly indicated here by the word <![CDATA[ <i>bhaktya.</i>]]> No other process can help one attain that supreme abode. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Gopala-tapani Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.21) also describe the supreme abode and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <![CDATA[ <i>Eko vasi sarva-ga? k???a?.</i>]]> In that abode there is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose name is K???a. He is the supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> compare the Lord to a tree standing still yet bearing many varieties of fruits, flowers and changing leaves. The plenary expansions of the Lord who preside over the Vaiku??ha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of names—Puru?ottama, Trivikrama, Kesava, Madhava, Aniruddha, H??ikesa, Sa?kar?a?a, Pradyumna, Sridhara, Vasudeva, Damodara, Janardana, Naraya?a, Vamana, Padmanabha, etc.<p></p>
        <p>
          The <![CDATA[ <i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.37) also confirms that although the Lord is always in the supreme abode, Goloka V?ndavana, He is all-pervading, so that everything is going on nicely (<![CDATA[ <i>goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhuta?</i>]]>). As stated in the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[ <i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>6.8), <![CDATA[ <i>parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate/ svabhaviki jñana-bala-kriya ca: <it->

      The unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord, who are totally surrendered souls, do not care when they leave their bodies or by what method. They leave everything in K???a''s hands and so easily and happily return to Godhead. But those who are not unalloyed devotees and who depend instead on such methods of spiritual realization as <![CDATA[ <i>karma-yoga, jñana-yoga</i>]]> and <![CDATA[ <i>ha?ha-yoga</i>]]> must leave the body at a suitable time and thereby be assured whether or not they will return to the world of birth and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the <![CDATA[ <i>yogi</i>]]> is perfect he can select the time and situation for leaving this material world. But if he is not so expert his success depends on his accidentally passing away at a certain suitable time. The suitable times at which one passes away and does not come back are explained by the Lord in the next verse. According to Acarya Baladeva Vidyabhu?a?a, the Sanskrit word <![CDATA[ <i>kala</i>]]> used herein refers to the presiding deity of time.

      When fire, light, day and the fortnight of the moon are mentioned, it is to be understood that over all of them there are various presiding deities who make arrangements for the passage of the soul. At the time of death, the mind carries one on the path to a new life. If one leaves the body at the time designated above, either accidentally or by arrangement, it is possible for him to attain the impersonal <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir.</i>]]> Mystics who are advanced in <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> practice can arrange the time and place to leave the body. Others have no control—if by accident they leave at an auspicious moment, then they will not return to the cycle of birth and death, but otherwise there is every possibility that they will have to return. However, for the pure devotee in K???a consciousness, there is no fear of returning, whether he leaves the body at an auspicious or inauspicious moment, by accident or arrangement.

      In the Third Canto of <![CDATA[ <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> Kapila Muni mentions that those who are expert in fruitive activities and sacrificial methods on earth attain to the moon at death.

      K???a is here advising Arjuna that he should not be disturbed by the different paths the soul can take when leaving the material world. A devotee of the Supreme Lord should not worry whether he will depart by arrangement or by accident. The devotee should be firmly established in K???a consciousness and chant Hare K???a. He should know that concern over either of these two paths is troublesome. The best way to be absorbed in K???a consciousness is to be always dovetailed in His service, and this will make one''s path to the spiritual kingdom safe, certain and direct. The word <![CDATA[ <i>yoga-yukta</i>]]> is especially significant in this verse. One who is firm in <![CDATA[ <i>yoga</i>]]> is constantly engaged in K???a consciousness in all his activities. Sri Rupa Gosvami advises, <![CDATA[ <i>anasaktasya vi?ayan yatharham upayuñjata?:</i>]]> one should be unattached in material affairs and do everything in K???a consciousness. By this system, which is called <![CDATA[ <i><it>yukta-vairagya<it>,</it></it></i>]]> one attains perfection. Therefore the devotee is not disturbed by these descriptions, because he knows that his passage to the supreme abode is guaranteed by devotional service.

  <slokas chapter="8" sloka="28">
    <p>
      This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth chapters, which particularly deal with K???a consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacari</i>]]> has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master''s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacarya.</i>]]>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the student studies the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> under the master for some time—at least from from age five to twenty—he becomes a man of perfect character. Study of the <![CDATA[ <i>Vedas</i>]]> is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacari</i>]]> is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many sacrifices so that he may achieve further enlightenment. He must also give charity according to the country, time and candidate, discriminating among charity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of <![CDATA[ <i>vanaprastha,</i>]]> he undergoes severe penances—living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of <![CDATA[ <i>brahmacarya,</i>]]> householder life, <![CDATA[ <i>vanaprastha</i>]]> and finally <![CDATA[ <i>sannyasa,</i>]]> one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal <![CDATA[ <i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> or in the Vaiku??ha planets or K???aloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.
    </p>
    <p>The beauty of K???a consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different orders of life.</p>
    <p>
      The words <![CDATA[ <i>ida? viditva</i>]]> indicate that one should understand the instructions given by Sri K???a in this chapter and the Seventh Chapter of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in association with devotees. Chapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The first six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, which are especially protected by the Lord. If one is fortunate enough to understand <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]>—especially these middle six chapters—in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc., for one can achieve all the results of these activities simply by K???a consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      One who has a little faith in <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> should learn <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> from a devotee, because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly that <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> can be understood only by devotees; no one else can perfectly understand the purpose of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> One should therefore learn <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> from a devotee of K???a, not from mental speculators. This is a sign of faith. When one searches for a devotee and fortunately gets a devotee''s association one actually begins to study and understand <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> By advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional service, and this service dispels all one''s misgivings about K???a, or God, and K???a''s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these misgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one''s study. Then one relishes the study of <![CDATA[ <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and attains the state of feeling always K???a conscious. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K???a. This highest perfectional stage of life enables the devotee to be transferred to K???a''s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V?ndavana, where the devotee becomes eternally happy.

      As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam:</i> "The messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees. This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>The devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord''s service. The Lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in K???a consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of K???a in the association of devotees. Discussion of K???a is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization. Lord K???a, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more confidential than any He has already disclosed.</p>

      The very beginning of <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> the First Chapter, is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third chapters, the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the Seventh and Eighth chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in K???a consciousness, they are called more confidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of K???a is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the material world. In the <i>Bhakti-rasam?ta-sindhu</i> it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated. Similarly, we shall find in the <i>Bhagavad-gita,</i> Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this first verse has specific significance. The words <i>ida? jñanam</i> ("this knowledge") refer to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness, K???a consciousness. When one''s heart is thus cleared of material contamination, one can understand this science of K???a. Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who understands that he is not the body.
    </p>
    <p>In the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and superior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapter Nine the glories of the Lord will be delineated.</p>
    <p>
      The Sanskrit word <i>anasuyave</i> in this verse is also very significant. Generally the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> very inaccurately. Because they are envious of K???a, their commentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are bona fide. No one can explain <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> or give perfect knowledge of K???a if he is envious. One who criticizes the character of K???a without knowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who understands that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.

  <slokas chapter="9" sloka="2">
    <p>
      This chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. Among the principal philosophers in India are Gautama, Ka?ada, Kapila, Yajñavalkya, Sa??ilya and Vaisvanara. And finally there is Vyasadeva, the author of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra.</i>]]> So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service.
    </p>
    <p>Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part of the body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value. Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul.</p>
    <p>
      The <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable (<![CDATA[<i><it>antavanta ime deha nityasyokta? sariri?a?</it></i>]]><it>). That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that the spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.<p>
          <p>
            This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as explained in Vedic literature. In the <![CDATA[<i>Padma Pura?a,</i>]]> man''s sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still to be enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain.
          </p>
          <p>
            As explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter, a person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. This statement is confirmed in the <![CDATA[<i>Padma Pura?a:</i>]]><p>
              <p>
                aprarabdha-phala? papa?<br/>
                ku?a? bija? phalonmukham<br/>
                krame?aiva praliyeta<br/>
                vi??u-bhakti-ratatmanam
              </p>
              <p>
                For those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called <![CDATA[<i>pavitram uttamam,</i>]]> the purest. <![CDATA[<i>Uttama</i>]]> means transcendental. <![CDATA[<i>Tamas</i>]]> means this material world or darkness, and <![CDATA[<i>uttama</i>]]> means that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material activities. They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature.
              </p>
              <p>It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of K???a (Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare) in course of chanting without offenses feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of K???a consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.</p>
              <p>
                In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Vedanta-sutra</bd-></i>]]><bd>(3.2.26) this is also described in the following words: <![CDATA[<i>prakasas ca karma?y abhyasat.</i>]]> "Devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the activities of devotional service one becomes enlightened without a doubt." A practical example of this can be seen in the previous life of Narada, who in that life happened to be the son of a maidservant. He had no education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees, Narada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. Narada personally says,<p>
                    <p>
                      ucchi??a-lepan anumodito dvijai?<br/>
                      sak?t sma bhuñje tad-apasta-kilbi?a?<br/>
                      eva? prav?ttasya visuddha-cetasas<br/>
                      tad-dharma evatma-ruci? prajayate
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In this verse from <![CDATA[<i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.5.25) Narada describes his previous life to his disciple Vyasadeva. He says that while engaged as a boy servant for those purified devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they gave it Narada ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on eating, he gradually became as pure-hearted as the sages. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service to the Lord by hearing and chanting, and Narada gradually developed the same taste. Narada says further,<p>
                          <p>
                            tatranvaha? k???a-katha? pragayatam<br/>
                            anugrahe?as??ava? manohara?<br/>
                            ta? sraddhaya me ''nupada? vis??vata?<br/>
                            priyasravasy a?ga mamabhavad ruci?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            By associating with the sages, Narada got the taste for hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service. Therefore, as described in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra,</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>prakasas ca karma?y abhyasat:</i>]]> if one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is called <![CDATA[<i>pratyak?a,</i>]]> directly perceived.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The word <![CDATA[<i>dharmyam</i>]]> means "the path of religion." Narada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees. The child Narada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religion. The highest goal of all religion is devotional service, as stated in <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><it>sa vai pu?sa? paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok?aje</it></i>]]><it>). Religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of devotional service. As we have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight (<![CDATA[<i><it>vede?u yajñe?u tapa?su caiva</it></i>]]><it>), generally Vedic knowledge is required for self-realization. But here, although Narada never went to the school of the spiritual master and was not educated in the Vedic principles, he acquired the highest results of Vedic study. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: <![CDATA[<i>acaryavan puru?o veda.</i>]]> One who is in association with great <![CDATA[<i>acaryas,</i>]]> even if he is not educated or has never studied the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization.<p>
                                  <p>
                                    The process of devotional service is a very happy one (<![CDATA[<i>su-sukham</i>]]>). Why? Devotional service consists of <![CDATA[<i>srava?a? kirtana? vi??o? <it->[<it>SB<it-><it></it></it-></it></it-></i>]]>7.5.23]<![CDATA[<i>,</i>]]> so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized <![CDATA[<i>acaryas.</i>]]> Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, <it><![CDATA[<i>patra? pu?pa? phala? toyam<it>:</it></i>]]> He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by <![CDATA[<i>any</i>]]> person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply by tasting the <![CDATA[<i>tulasi</i>]]> leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kumara became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.<p>
                                        <p>It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as the Mayavadi philosophers claim. Although they sometimes take to so-called devotional service, their idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will continue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they will "become one with God." Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          As will be seen in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> actual devotional service begins after liberation. After one is liberated, when one is situated in the Brahman position (<![CDATA[<i>brahma-bhuta <it->[<it>SB 4.30.20<it->]</it-></it></it-></i>]]><it>), one''s devotional service begins (<![CDATA[<i><it>sama? sarve?u bhute?u mad-bhakti? labhate param</it></i>]]><it>). No one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing <![CDATA[<i>karma-yoga, jñana-yoga, a??a?ga-yoga</i>]]> or any other <![CDATA[<i>yoga</i>]]> independently. By these yogic methods one may make a little progress toward <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> but without coming to the stage of devotional service one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> or <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> from realized souls, then he can understand the science of K???a, or the science of God. <![CDATA[<i><it>Eva? prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti yogata?<it>.</it></it></i>]]> When one''s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of K???a consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it. <p></p>

      The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees. Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from great personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most important factor for progress in K???a consciousness. In the <![CDATA[<i>Caitanya-caritam?ta</i>]]> it is said that faith is the complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord, Sri K???a, one can achieve all perfection. That is called real faith. As stated in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>,<p>
          <p>
            yatha taror mula-ni?ecanena<br/>

                            "By giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs and leaves, and by supplying food to the stomach one satisfies all the senses of the body. Similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord one automatically satisfies all the demigods and all other living entities." Therefore, after reading <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> one should promptly come to the conclusion of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita:</i>]]> one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of the Supreme Lord, K???a, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Now, the development of that faith is the process of K???a consciousness. There are three divisions of K???a conscious men. In the third class are those who have no faith. Even if they are officially engaged in devotional service, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven''t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in K???a consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to K???a consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can advance in K???a consciousness. As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class person in K???a consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that <![CDATA[<i>k???a-bhakti,</i>]]> or service to K???a, is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the third class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person in K???a consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class he does not fall down, and for the first-class person in K???a consciousness there is no chance of falling down. One in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in K???a consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to K???a is very good, he has not yet gained adequate knowledge of K???a through the scriptures like <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> Sometimes these third-class persons in K???a consciousness have some tendency toward <![CDATA[<i>karma-yoga</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>jñana-yoga,</i>]]> and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection of <![CDATA[<i>karma-yoga</i>]]> or <![CDATA[<i>jñana-yoga</i>]]> is vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in K???a consciousness. Faith in K???a is also divided into three stages and described in <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam.</i>]]> First-class attachment, second-class attachment and third-class attachment are also explained in <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing about K???a and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope of gaining perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.

                      <p>
                        Lord Sri K???a''s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.38) it is stated, <![CDATA[<i>premañjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa? sadaiva h?daye?u vilokayanti:</i>]]> one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is not conceivable by the material senses. This is indicated here by the word <![CDATA[<i>avyakta-murtina.</i>]]> But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies—the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy.<p>
                            <p>
                              Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such an argument the Lord says, "I am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof." For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king''s energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king''s power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see and everything that exists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as stated in the <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i><it>vi??abhyaham ida? k?tsnam<it>:</it></it></i>]]> He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.

      The Lord says that everything is resting on Him (<![CDATA[<i>mat-sthani sarva-bhutani<it->[<it>Bg<it->. </it-></it></it-></i>]]><it>
        9.4]). This should not be misunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection with K???a''s upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is resting on Him, He is aloof. The planetary systems are floating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from space. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says, "Although they are situated on My inconceivable energy, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead I am aloof from them." This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord.<p>
          <p>
            In the <![CDATA[<i>Nirukti</i>]]> Vedic dictionary it is said, <![CDATA[<i>yujyate ''nena durgha?e?u karye?u:</i>]]> "The Supreme Lord is performing inconceivably wonderful pastimes, displaying His energy." His person is full of different potent energies, and His determination is itself actual fact. In this way the Personality of Godhead is to be understood. We may think of doing something, but there are so many impediments, and sometimes it is not possible to do as we like. But when K???a wants to do something, simply by His willing, everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of the entire material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His supreme will, everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is maintained, and everything is annihilated. There is no difference between His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is present in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also present personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet everything is resting on Him. This is explained here as <![CDATA[<i>yogam aisvaram,</i>]]> the mystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

    <p>For the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material creation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which may help us to understand. The sky may be the biggest manifestation we can conceive. And in that sky the wind or air is the biggest manifestation in the cosmic world. The movement of the air influences the movements of everything. But although the wind is great, it is still situated within the sky; the wind is not beyond the sky. Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as the sky is always aloof from the activities of the wind.</p>
    <p>
      In the <![CDATA[<i>Upani?ads</i>]]> it is stated, <![CDATA[<i>yad-bhi?a vata? pavate:</i>]]> "It is out of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing." (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Taittiriya Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>2.8.1) In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->B?had-ara?yaka Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(3.8.9) it is stated, <![CDATA[<i>etasya va ak?arasya prasasane gargi surya-candramasau vidh?tau ti??hata etasya va ak?arasya prasasane gargi dyav-ap?thivyau vidh?tau ti??hata?.</i>]]> "By the supreme order, under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun, and the other great planets are moving." In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.52) also it is stated,<p>

              <p>This is a description of the movement of the sun. It is said that the sun is considered to be one of the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat and light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the supreme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that this material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and great, is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This will be further explained in the later verses of this chapter. </p>

      The creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material cosmic manifestation are completely dependent on the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead. "At the end of the millennium" means at the death of Brahma. Brahma lives for one hundred years, and his one day is calculated at 4,300,000,000 of our earthly years. His night is of the same duration. His month consists of thirty such days and nights, and his year of twelve months. After one hundred such years, when Brahma dies, the devastation or annihilation takes place; this means that the energy manifested by the Supreme Lord is again wound up in Himself. Then again, when there is a need to manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will. <![CDATA[<i>Bahu syam:</i>]]> "Although I am one, I shall become many." This is the Vedic aphorism (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Chandogya Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>6.2.3). He expands Himself in this material energy, and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes place.<p></p>

      This material world is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This has already been explained several times. At the creation, the material energy is let loose as the <![CDATA[<i>mahat-tattva,</i>]]> into which the Lord as His first <it>puru?a<it>incarnation, Maha-vi??u, enters. He lies within the Causal Ocean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into each universe the Lord again enters as Garbhodakasayi Vi??u. Each universe is in that way created. He still further manifests Himself as K?irodakasayi Vi??u, and that Vi??u enters into everything—even into the minute atom. This fact is explained here. He enters into everything.<p>
            <p>
              Now, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated into this material nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take different positions. Thus the activities of this material world begin. The activities of the different species of living beings are begun from the very moment of the creation. It is not that all is evolved. The different species of life are created immediately along with the universe. Men, animals, beasts, birds—everything is simultaneously created, because whatever desires the living entities had at the last annihilation are again manifested. It is clearly indicated here by the word <![CDATA[<i>avasam</i>]]> that the living entities have nothing to do with this process. The state of being in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again, and all this is done simply by His will. This is the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of God. And after creating different species of life, He has no connection with them. The creation takes place to accommodate the inclinations of the various living entities, and so the Lord does not become involved with it.

      One should not think, in this connection, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no engagement. In His spiritual world He is always engaged. In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.6) it is stated, <![CDATA[<i>atmaramasya tasyasti prak?tya na samagama?:</i>]]> "He is always involved in His eternal, blissful, spiritual activities, but He has nothing to do with these material activities." Material activities are being carried on by His different potencies. The Lord is always neutral in the material activities of the created world. This neutrality is mentioned here with the word <![CDATA[<i>udasina-vat.</i>]]> Although He has control over every minute detail of material activities, He is sitting as if neutral. The example can be given of a high-court judge sitting on his bench. By his order so many things are happening—someone is being hanged, someone is being put into jail, someone is awarded a huge amount of wealth—but still he is neutral. He has nothing to do with all that gain and loss. Similarly, the Lord is always neutral, although He has His hand in every sphere of activity. In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Vedanta-sutra</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.1.34) it is stated, <![CDATA[<i>vai?amya-nairgh??ye na:</i>]]> He is not situated in the dualities of this material world. He is transcendental to these dualities. Nor is He attached to the creation and annihilation of this material world. The living entities take their different forms in the various species of life according to their past deeds, and the Lord doesn''t interfere with them. <p></p></bd>

      It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the activities of the material world, remains the supreme director. The Supreme Lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the management is being conducted by material nature. K???a also states in <![CDATA[<i><it>Bhagavad-gita</it></i>]]> <it>that of all of the living entities in different forms and species, "I am the father." The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different forms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created immediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the <![CDATA[<i>sm?ti:</i>]]> when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material activities. <p></p></it>

      From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider K???a to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><it>isvara? parama? k???a?</it></i>]]><it>); He is the Supreme Lord.<p>
          <p>
            There are many <![CDATA[<i>isvaras,</i>]]> controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> it is said that K???a is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly, both in the material and spiritual world, but K???a is the supreme controller (<![CDATA[<i><it>isvara? parama? k???a?</it></i>]]><it>). and His body is <![CDATA[<i>sac-cid-ananda,</i>]]> nonmaterial.<p>
                <p>
                  Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here <![CDATA[<i>manu?im</i>]]> because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna''s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruk?etra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is <![CDATA[<i>sac-cid-ananda-vigraha</i>]]><it><![CDATA[<i><it->[Bs.<it> </it></it-></i>]]>5.1<it->]<it>—eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed in the Vedic language also. <![CDATA[<i>Sac-cid-ananda-rupaya k???aya:</i>]]> "I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge." (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Gopala-tapani Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.1) There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also. <![CDATA[<i>Tam eka? govindam:</i>]]> "You are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows." <![CDATA[<i>Sac-cid-ananda-vigraham:</i>]]> "And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality." (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Gopala-tapani Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.38)<p>
                              <p>
                                Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord K???a''s body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> who deride K???a as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of Sri K???a is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called <![CDATA[<i>mu?ha,</i>]]> for only foolish persons consider K???a to be an ordinary human being. The foolish consider K???a an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that K???a''s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not know that K???a has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.
                              </p>

                                Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places (<![CDATA[<i><it>mama maya duratyaya</it></i>]]><it>), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to K???a can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of K???a is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, K???a, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His <![CDATA[<i><it>yogam aisvaram<it>,</it></it></i>]]> His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how K???a, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in K???a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.<p>

                                      There are many controversies between the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord''s appearance as a human being. But if we consult <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i>]]> the authoritative texts for understanding the science of K???a, then we can understand that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i>]]> First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by Saunaka inquired about the activities of K???a, they said:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                    <p>
                                      "Lord Sri K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with Balarama, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts." (<![CDATA[<i><bd->SB</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.1.20) The Lord''s appearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that K???a performed while He was present on this earth. When K???a appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaki, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. As stated in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(10.3.46), <![CDATA[<i>babhuva prak?ta? sisu?:</i>]]> He became just like an ordinary child, an ordinary human being. Now, here again it is indicated that the Lord''s appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see K???a''s form of four hands (<![CDATA[<i><it>tenaiva rupe?a catur-bhujena</it></i>]]><it>). After revealing this form, K???a, when petitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form (<![CDATA[<i><it>manu?a? rupam</it></i>]]><it>). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.<p>
                                                <p>
                                                  Some of those who deride K???a and who are infected with the Mayavadi philosophy quote the following verse from the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(3.29.21) to prove that K???a is just an ordinary man. <![CDATA[<i>Aha? sarve?u bhute?u bhutatmavasthita? sada:</i>]]> "The Supreme is present in every living entity." We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vai??ava <![CDATA[<i>acaryas</i>]]> like Jiva Gosvami and Visvanatha Cakravarti ?hakura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride K???a. Jiva Gosvami, commenting on this verse, says that K???a, in His plenary expansion as Paramatma, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the <![CDATA[<i>arca-murti,</i>]]> the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Visvanatha Cakravarti ?hakura warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that because K???a is present in everyone''s heart as Paramatma, every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in which the Paramatma dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.<p>
                                                      <p>
                                                        There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in K???a consciousness knows that although K???a is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as confirmed in the <![CDATA[<i><it>Brahma-sa?hita<it>.</it></it></i>]]> Although His personal abode is Goloka V?ndavana and He is always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.

      There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in K???a consciousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit of devotional service—going back to Godhead—will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. In other words, persons who mock K???a are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> such demonic miscreants never surrender to K???a. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and K???a are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one with K???a will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> and the <![CDATA[<i>Upani?ads.</i>]]> is always baffled.<p>
        <p>
          It is a great offense, therefore, to consider K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of K???a. The <![CDATA[<i>B?had-vi??u-sm?ti</i>]]> clearly states:
        </p>
        <p>
          yo vetti bhautika? deha?<br/>
          k???asya paramatmana?<br/>
          sa sarvasmad bahi?-karya?<br/>
          srauta-smarta-vidhanata?<br/>
          mukha? tasyavalokyapi<br/>sa-cela? snanam acaret
        </p>
        <p>
          "One who considers the body of K???a to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the <![CDATA[<i>sruti</i>]]> and the <![CDATA[<i>sm?ti.</i>]]> And if one by chance sees his face, one should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself of infection." People jeer at K???a because they are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real knowledge will remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest region of creation.

      In this verse the description of the <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> is clearly given. The first sign of the <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the qualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called <![CDATA[<i>daivi prak?ti,</i>]]> divine nature. So when one is promoted in that way—by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead—one attains to the stage of great soul, <![CDATA[<i>mahatma.</i>]]><p></p>
      <p>
        The <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> does not divert his attention to anything outside K???a, because he knows perfectly well that K???a is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a <![CDATA[<i>mahatma,</i>]]> or great soul, develops through association with other <![CDATA[<i>mahatmas,</i>]]> pure devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by K???a''s other features, such as the four-armed Maha-vi??u. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of K???a. They are not attracted to other features of K???a, nor are they concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They meditate only upon K???a in K???a consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in K???a consciousness.

  <slokas chapter="9" sloka="14">
    <p>
      The <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary man. His symptoms are described here: a <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> is always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord K???a, the Personality of Godhead. He has no other business. He is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not an impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these things; therefore a <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir,</i>]]> is not described as <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> in the <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> He is described in a different way in the next verse. The <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> is always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i>]]> hearing and chanting about Vi??u, not a demigod or human being. That is devotion: <![CDATA[<i><it>srava?a? kirtana? vi??o?</it></i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>smara?am<it>,</it></i>]]> remembering Him. Such a <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five transcendental <![CDATA[<i>rasas.</i>]]> To achieve that success, he engages all activities—mental, bodily and vocal, everything—in the service of the Supreme Lord, Sri K???a. That is called full K???a consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ekadasi, and on the appearance day of the Lord. All these rules and regulations are offered by the great <![CDATA[<i>acaryas</i>]]> for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world. The <![CDATA[<i>mahatmas,</i>]]> great souls, strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result.
    </p>
    <p>
      As described in the second verse of this chapter, not only is this devotional service easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a <![CDATA[<i>sannyasi</i>]]> or a <![CDATA[<i>brahmacari;</i>]]> in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually <![CDATA[<i>mahatma,</i>]]> a great soul.

      This verse is the summary of the previous verses. The Lord tells Arjuna that those who are purely in K???a consciousness and do not know anything other than K???a are called <![CDATA[<i>mahatma;</i>]]> yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the position of <![CDATA[<i>mahatma</i>]]> but who worship K???a also, in different ways. Some of them have already been described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the inquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But there are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: (1) he who worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, (2) he who concocts some form of the Supreme Lord and worships that, and (3) he who accepts the universal form, the <![CDATA[<i>visvarupa</i>]]> of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way. The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord.

The <![CDATA[<i>mantras</i>]]> chanted in this connection are also K???a. And many other commodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also K???a. The fire is also K???a because fire is one of the five material elements and is therefore claimed as the separated energy of K???a. In other words, the Vedic sacrifices recommended in the <![CDATA[<i>karma-ka??a</i>]]> division of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> are in total also K???a. Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering devotional service unto K???a are to be understood to have performed all the sacrifices recommended in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas.</i>]]><p></p>

      The entire cosmic manifestations, moving and nonmoving, are manifested by different activities of K???a''s energy. In the material existence we create different relationships with different living entities who are nothing but K???a''s marginal energy; under the creation of <![CDATA[<i>prak?ti</i>]]> some of them appear as our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts and parcels of K???a. As such, these living entities who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing but K???a. In this verse the word <![CDATA[<i>dhata</i>]]> means "creator." Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of K???a, but the creator, grandmother and grandfather, etc., are also K???a. Actually any living entity, being part and parcel of K???a, is K???a. All the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> therefore, aim only toward K???a. Whatever we want to know through the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> is but a progressive step toward understanding K???a. That subject matter which helps us purify our constitutional position is especially K???a. Similarly, the living entity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and parcel of K???a and as such is also K???a. In all the Vedic <![CDATA[<i>mantras</i>]]> the word <![CDATA[<i>o?,</i>]]> called <![CDATA[<i>pra?ava,</i>]]> is a transcendental sound vibration and is also K???a. And because in all the hymns of the four <![CDATA[<i>Vedas-Sama, Yajur, ?g</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Atharva</i>]]>-the <![CDATA[<i>pra?ava,</i>]]> or <![CDATA[<i>o?kara,</i>]]> is very prominent, it is understood to be K???a.

      <![CDATA[<i>Gati</i>]]> means the destination where we want to go. But the ultimate goal is K???a, although people do not know it. One who does not know K???a is misled, and his so-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory. There are many who make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of the strict respective methods they reach different planets known as Candraloka, Suryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But all such <![CDATA[<i>lokas,</i>]]> or planets, being creations of K???a, are simultaneously K???a and not K???a. Such planets, being manifestations of K???a''s energy, are also K???a, but actually they serve only as a step forward for realization of K???a. To approach the different energies of K???a is to approach K???a indirectly. One should directly approach K???a, for that will save time and energy. For example, if there is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an elevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is resting on K???a''s energy; therefore without K???a''s shelter nothing can exist. K???a is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything exists on His energy. K???a, being situated in everyone''s heart, is the supreme witness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also K???a. K???a is the ultimate goal of shelter, and therefore one should take shelter of K???a either for protection or for annihilation of his distress. And whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be a living force. K???a is the supreme living entity. And since K???a is the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend than K???a, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. K???a is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. K???a is therefore the eternal cause of all causes.

    <p>K???a, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency of electricity and the sun. During summer season it is K???a who checks rain from falling from the sky, and then during the rainy season He gives unceasing torrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of our life is K???a, and K???a meets us at the end as death. By analyzing all these different energies of K???a, one can ascertain that for K???a there is no distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is both matter and spirit. In the advanced stage of K???a consciousness, one therefore makes no such distinctions. He sees only K???a in everything.</p>
    <p>Since K???a is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form comprising all material manifestations is also K???a, and His pastimes in V?ndavana as two-handed Syamasundara, playing on a flute, are those of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. </p>

      The word <![CDATA[<i>trai-vidya?</i>]]> refers to the three <![CDATA[<i>Vedas-Sama, Yajur</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>?g.</i>]]> A <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a</i>]]> who has studied these three <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> is called a <![CDATA[<i>tri-vedi.</i>]]> Anyone who is very much attached to knowledge derived from these three <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> respected in society. Unfortunately, there are many great scholars of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> who do not know the ultimate purport of studying them. Therefore K???a herein declares Himself to be the ultimate goal for the <![CDATA[<i>tri-vedis.</i>]]> Actual <![CDATA[<i>tri-vedis</i>]]> take shelter under the lotus feet of K???a and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord. Devotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare K???a <![CDATA[<i>mantra</i>]]> and side by side trying to understand K???a in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply official students of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> become more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like Indra and Candra. By such endeavor, the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary systems or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet.

      One who is promoted to the higher planetary systems enjoys a longer duration of life and better facilities for sense enjoyment, yet one is not allowed to stay there forever.

He who has not attained perfection of knowledge, as indicated in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><it>janmady asya yata?</it></i>]]><it>), or, in other words, he who fails to understand K???a, the cause of all causes, becomes baffled about achieving the ultimate goal of life and is thus subjected to the routine of being promoted to the higher planets and then again coming down, as if situated on a Ferris wheel which sometimes goes up and sometimes comes down. The purport is that instead of being elevated to the spiritual world, from which there is no longer any possibility of coming down, one simply revolves in the cycle of birth and death on higher and lower planetary systems. One should better take to the spiritual world to enjoy an eternal life full of bliss and knowledge and never return to this miserable material existence. <p></p>

Such activities are all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies, which make the devotee perfect in self-realization, so that his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee undoubtedly approaches the Lord without difficulty. This is called <![CDATA[<i>yoga.</i>]]> By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life. <![CDATA[<i>K?ema</i>]]> refers to the merciful protection of the Lord.

      "Persons who are engaged in the worship of demigods are not very intelligent, although such worship is offered to Me indirectly," K???a says. For example, when a man pours water on the leaves and branches of a tree without pouring water on the root, he does so without sufficient knowledge or without observing regulative principles. Similarly, the process of rendering service to different parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach. The demigods are, so to speak, different officers and directors in the government of the Supreme Lord. One has to follow the laws made by the government, not by the officers or directors. Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only. That will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the Lord. The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the government, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal. This is stated here as <![CDATA[<i>avidhi-purvakam.</i>]]> In other words, K???a does not approve the unnecessary worship of the demigods.

      Here it is clearly stated that there are many types of <![CDATA[<i>yajña</i>]]> performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. <![CDATA[<i>Yajña</i>]]> means Vi??u. In the Third Chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying Yajña, or Vi??u. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as <![CDATA[<i>var?asrama-dharma,</i>]]> is specifically meant for satisfying Vi??u. Therefore, K???a says in this verse, "I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master." Less intelligent persons, however, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result. <p></p>

      If one has any desire to go to the moon, the sun or any other planet, one can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles recommended for that purpose, such as the process technically known as <![CDATA[<i>darsa-paur?amasi.</i>]]> These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the Pita planets by performing a specific <![CDATA[<i>yajña.</i>]]> Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a Yak?a, Rak?a or Pisaca. Pisaca worship is called "black arts" or "black magic." There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of Vaiku??ha and K???aloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the Pitas achieve the Pita planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of K???a or Vi??u? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where K???a and Vi??u live, and because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir.</i>]]> The K???a consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare K???a <![CDATA[<i>mantra</i>]]> one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead.

      For the intelligent person, it is essential to be in K???a consciousness, engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, in order to achieve a permanent, blissful abode for eternal happiness. The process of achieving such a marvelous result is very easy and can be attempted even by the poorest of the poor, without any kind of qualification. The only qualification required in this connection is to be a pure devotee of the Lord. It does not matter what one is or where one is situated. The process is so easy that even a leaf or a little water or fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will be pleased to accept it. No one, therefore, can be barred from K???a consciousness, because it is so easy and universal. Who is such a fool that he does not want to be K???a conscious by this simple method and thus attain the highest perfectional life of eternity, bliss and knowledge? K???a wants only loving service and nothing more. K???a accepts even a little flower from His pure devotee. He does not want any kind of offering from a nondevotee. He is not in need of anything from anyone, because He is self-sufficient, and yet He accepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of love and affection. To develop K???a consciousness is the highest perfection of life. <![CDATA[<i>Bhakti</i>]]> is mentioned twice in this verse in order to declare more emphatically that <![CDATA[<i>bhakti,</i>]]> or devotional service, is the only means to approach K???a. No other condition, such as becoming a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a,</i>]]> a learned scholar, a very rich man or a great philosopher, can induce K???a to accept some offering. Without the basic principle of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti,</i>]]> nothing can induce the Lord to agree to accept anything from anyone. <![CDATA[<i>Bhakti</i>]]> is never causal. The process is eternal. It is direct action in service to the absolute whole.
    </p>
    <p>Here Lord K???a, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life—the transcendental loving service of God—then one should find out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves K???a will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. Thus meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to K???a. If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, "I will accept it." Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord K???a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.</p>
    <p>
      In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, Sri K???a explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord K???a and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love. K???a has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for K???a.<p></p>
      <p>
        The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of K??a, the speaker of the <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> But, in actuality, K???a, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that K???a is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, K???a has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, K???a''s hearing the devotee''s words of love in offering foodstuffs is <![CDATA[<i>wholly</i>]]> identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts K???a as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.

      Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget K???a in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and K???a recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K???a. Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore K???a recommends, "Do it for Me," and this is called <![CDATA[<i>arcana.</i>]]> Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity; K???a says, "Give it to Me," and this means that all surplus money accumulated should be utilized in furthering the K???a consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on K???a twenty-four hours a day by chanting the Hare K???a <![CDATA[<i>mantra</i>]]> round his beads, he is surely the greatest meditator and the greatest <![CDATA[<i>yogi.</i>]]> As substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of <![CDATA[<i><it>Bhagavad-gita<it>.</it></it></i>]]> <p></p>

      One who acts in K???a consciousness under superior direction is called <![CDATA[<i>yukta-vairagya.</i>]]> The technical term is yukta-vairagya<![CDATA[<i>.</i>]]> This is further explained by Rupa Gosvami as follows:<p>

                      Rupa Gosvami says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act; we cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to K???a, then that is called <![CDATA[<i>yukta-vairagya.</i>]]> Actually situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he becomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he does not become one with the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir,</i>]]> but rather enters into the planet of the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: <![CDATA[<i>mam upai?yasi,</i>]]> &quot;he comes to Me,&quot; back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, and here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly in the association of the Supreme Lord.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Anyone who has no interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the Lord is actually a <![CDATA[<i>sannyasi.</i>]]> Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant, dependent on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas.</i>]]> For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is said, therefore, by Vai??ava authorities that even the most intelligent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact words are <![CDATA[<i>ta?ra vakya, kriya, mudra vijñeha na bujhaya</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Caitanya-caritam?ta, Madhya</bd-></i>]]>23.39). A person who is thus always engaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to serve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present, and in the future his going back home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. He is above all materialistic criticism, just as K???a is above all criticism. <p></p>

    <p>
      One may question here that if K???a is equal to everyone and no one is His special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living entity—in whatever form—is His son, and so He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in K???a consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in K???a. The very phrase "K???a consciousness" suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here distinctly, <![CDATA[<i>mayi te:</i>]]> "They are in Me." Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the words <![CDATA[<i><it>ye yatha ma? prapadyante ta?s tathaiva bhajamy aham<it>:</it></it></i>]]> "Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him." This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the manifestation of the Lord''s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord''s reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of <![CDATA[<i>karma.</i>]]> It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function. Devotional service to the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world, where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="9" sloka="30">
    <p>
      The word <![CDATA[<i>su-duracara?</i>]]> used in this verse is very significant, and we should understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in K???a consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of K???a consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in K???a consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> it is stated that if a person falls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, purifies him and excuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a <![CDATA[<i>yogi</i>]]> fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but K???a consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path, for, as explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in K???a consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore a person who is situated in K???a consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen. The words <![CDATA[<i>sadhur eva,</i>]]> "he is saintly," are very emphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down. And the word <![CDATA[<i>mantavya?</i>]]> is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then one is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <![CDATA[<i>N?si?ha Pura?a</i>]]> the following statement is given:
    </p>
    <p>
      bhagavati ca harav ananya-ceta<br/>
      bh?sa-malino ''pi virajate manu?ya?<br/>
      na hi sasa-kalu?a-cchabi? kadacit<br/>
      timira-parabhavatam upaiti candra?
    </p>
    <p>The meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities, these activities should be considered to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on the moon. Such spots do not become an impediment to the diffusion of moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of saintly character does not make him abominable.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="9" sloka="31">
    <p>
      This should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says that one who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the Lord. One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever. The question remains, then, How can a person engaged in abominable activities—either by accident or by intention—be a pure devotee? This question may justly be raised. The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam.</i>]]> Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But here there is no such condition, because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage. This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations. <p></p>
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="9" sloka="32">
    <p>
      It is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there is no distinction between the lower and higher classes of people. In the material conception of life there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in transcendental devotional service to the Lord there are not. Everyone is eligible for the supreme destination. In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.4.18) it is stated that even the lowest, who are called <![CDATA[<i>ca??alas</i>]]> (dog-eaters), can be purified by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and the guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking shelter of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the different modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness (<![CDATA[<i>brahma?as</i>]]>), the mode of passion (<![CDATA[<i>k?atriyas,</i>]]> or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance (<![CDATA[<i>vaisyas,</i>]]> or merchants), and the mode of ignorance (<![CDATA[<i>sudras,</i>]]> or workers). Those lower than them are called <![CDATA[<i>ca??alas,</i>]]> and they are born in sinful families. Generally, the association of those born in sinful families is not accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service is so strong that the pure devotee of the Supreme Lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when one takes shelter of K???a. As indicated here by the word <![CDATA[<i>vyapasritya,</i>]]> one has to take shelter completely of K???a. Then one can become much greater than great <![CDATA[<i>jñanis</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>yogis.</i>]]> <p></p></bd>
    </p>
    </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="9" sloka="33">
    <p>
      In this material world there are classifications of people, but, after all, this world is not a happy place for anyone. It is clearly stated here, <![CDATA[<i>anityam asukha? lokam:</i>]]> this world is temporary and full of miseries, not habitable for any sane gentleman. This world is declared by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be temporary and full of miseries. Some philosophers, especially Mayavadi philosophers, say that this world is false, but we can understand from <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> that the world is not false; it is temporary. There is a difference between temporary and false. This world is temporary, but there is another world, which is eternal. This world is miserable, but the other world is eternal and blissful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arjuna was born in a saintly royal family. To him also the Lord says, "Take to My devotional service and come quickly back to Godhead, back home." No one should remain in this temporary world, full as it is with miseries. Everyone should attach himself to the bosom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that he can be eternally happy. The devotional service of the Supreme Lord is the only process by which all problems of all classes of men can be solved. Everyone should therefore take to K???a consciousness and make his life perfect. <p></p>
    </p>
                                                                                </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="9" sloka="34">
    <p>
      In this verse it is clearly indicated that K???a consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between K???a''s mind and K???a. K???a is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, His mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in the <![CDATA[<i>Kurma Pura?a.</i>]]> As it is quoted by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami in his <![CDATA[<i>Anubha?ya</i>]]> comments on <![CDATA[<i>Caitanya-caritam?ta</i>]]> (Fifth Chapter, <![CDATA[<i><it>Adi-lila<it>,</it></it></i>]]> verses 41-48), <![CDATA[<i>deha-dehi-vibhedo ''ya? nesvare vidyate kvacit.</i>]]> This means that there is no difference in K???a, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But because the commentators do not know this science of K???a, they hide K???a and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of K???a, some men make profit out of misleading people.<p>
        <p>
          There are some who are demonic; they also think of K???a, but enviously, just like King Ka?sa, K???a''s uncle. He was also thinking of K???a always, but he thought of K???a as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K???a would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of K???a in devotional love. That is <![CDATA[<i>bhakti.</i>]]> One should cultivate the knowledge of K???a continuously. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K???a will help one become a devotee. Understanding K???a otherwise, from the wrong source, will prove fruitless.
        </p>
        <p>One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of K???a; with conviction in his heart that K???a is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of K???a, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to K???a. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities-everything. That will make one fully absorbed in K???a without deviation. This will help one transfer to the K???aloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about K???a. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society.</p>
        <p>
          The Seventh and Eighth chapters of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> have explained pure devotional service to the Lord that is free from speculative knowledge, mystic <![CDATA[<i>yoga</i>]]> and fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> and localized Paramatma, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a beautiful poem about K???a in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K???a. The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and <![CDATA[<i>yogis.</i>]]> One who always engages in K???a consciousness should be understood to be a perfectly saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to the process of K???a consciousness and happily live in this material world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of K???a.
        </p>

          Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of theSrimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge.

<slokas chapter="10" sloka="2">
    <p>
      As stated in the <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sa?hita,</i>]]> Lord K???a is the Supreme Lord. No one is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand K???a; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such wonderful, uncommon activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand K???a. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand K???a by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand K???a by such foolish speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, &quot;&quot;Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.&quot;&quot; One should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand K???a, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam.</i>]]> The conception of God as some ruling power or as the impersonal Brahman can be reached by persons who are in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because most men cannot understand K???a in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the Supreme Lord''s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is K???a. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of K???a they can understand K???a. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is <![CDATA[<i>atma,</i>]]> what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.

  <slokas chapter="10" sloka="3">
    <p>
      As stated in the Seventh Chapter (7.3), <![CDATA[<i>manu?ya?a? sahasre?u kascid yatati siddhaye:</i>]]> those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men; they are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization. But out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most successful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully understood K???a''s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.
      <p>
        Here the Lord is described by the word <![CDATA[<i>aja,</i>]]> meaning &quot;&quot;unborn,&quot;&quot; but He is distinct from the living entities who are described in the Second Chapter as <![CDATA[<i>aja.</i>]]> The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment. The conditioned souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior, material energy, but is always in the superior energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse the words <![CDATA[<i>vetti loka-mahesvaram</i>]]> indicate that one should know that Lord K???a is the supreme proprietor of the planetary systems of the universe. He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as K???a is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore K???a is different even from the great demigods like Brahma and Siva. And because He is the creator of Brahma, Siva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all planets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sri K???a is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reactions. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other means, as stated in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]>
      </p>
      <p>One should not try to understand K???a as a human being. As stated previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all sinful reactions.</p>
      <p>
        If K???a is known as the son of Devaki, then how can He be unborn? That is also explained in <![CDATA[<i><it>Srimad-Bhagavatam<it>:</it></it></i>]]> When He appeared before Devaki and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anything done under the direction of K???a is transcendental. It cannot be contaminated by material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious. The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material nature is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends on activities in K???a consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called <![CDATA[<i>sannyasa.</i>]]> As stated in the first verse of the Sixth Chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to do so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his activities (<![CDATA[<i>anasrita? karma-phalam</i>]]>), is a true renouncer. Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a <![CDATA[<i>sannyasi</i>]]> and a <![CDATA[<i>yogi,</i>]]> and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the <![CDATA[<i>sannyasi,</i>]]> or a pseudo <![CDATA[<i>yogi.</i>]]>

      The Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population. Brahma is the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord, who is known as Hira?yagarbha. And from Brahma all the seven great sages, and before them four other great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana and Sanat-kumara, and the fourteen Manus, are manifested. All these twenty-five great sages are known as the patriarchs of the living entities all over the universe. There are innumerable universes and innumerable planets within each universe, and each planet is full of population of different varieties. All of them are born of these twenty-five patriarchs. Brahma underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods before he realized by the grace of K???a how to create. Then from Brahma came Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana and Sanat-kumara, then Rudra, and then the seven sages, and in this way all the <![CDATA[<i>brahma?as</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>k?atriyas</i>]]> are born out of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahma is known as Pitamaha, the grandfather, and K???a is known as <it>Prapitamaha<it>, the father of the grandfather.

      The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless one is firmly convinced of the different opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service. Generally people know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how God is great. Here are the details. If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord. When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no alternative but to surrender to Him. This factual knowledge can be known from the descriptions in <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and similar literatures.
    </p>
    <p>In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed throughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahma, Lord Siva and the four great Kumaras and the other patriarchs. There are many forefathers of the population of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme Lord, K???a. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, is the original forefather of all forefathers.</p>
    <p>These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is firmly convinced of them, he accepts K???a with great faith and without any doubt, and he engages in devotional service. All this particular knowledge is required in order to increase one''s interest in the loving devotional service of the Lord. One should not neglect to understand fully how great K???a is, for by knowing the greatness of K???a one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional service. </p>

      A learned scholar who has studied the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> perfectly and has information from authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachings can understand that K???a is the origin of everything in both the material and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes firmly fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He can never be deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that K???a is the source of Brahma, Siva and all other demigods. In the <![CDATA[<i>Atharva Veda</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Gopala-tapani Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.24) it is said, <![CDATA[<i>yo brahma?a? vidadhati purva? yo vai veda?s ca gapayati sma k???a?:</i>]]> &quot;&quot;It was K???a who in the beginning instructed Brahma in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past.&quot;&quot; Then again the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Naraya?a Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1) says, <![CDATA[<i>atha puru?o ha vai naraya?o ''kamayata praja? s?jeyeti:</i>]]> &quot;&quot;Then the Supreme Personality Naraya?a desired to create living entities.&quot;&quot; The <![CDATA[<i>Upani?ad</i>]]> continues, <![CDATA[<i>naraya?ad brahma jayate, naraya?ad prajapati? prajayate, naraya?ad indro jayate, naraya?ad a??au vasavo jayante, naraya?ad ekadasa rudra jayante, naraya?ad dvadasaditya?:</i>]]> &quot;&quot;From Naraya?a, Brahma is born, and from Naraya?a the patriarchs are also born. From Naraya?a, Indra is born, from Naraya?a the eight Vasus are born, from Naraya?a the eleven Rudras are born, from Naraya?a the twelve Adityas are born.&quot;&quot; This Naraya?a is an expansion of K???a.<p>
            <p>
              It is said in the same <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>brahma?yo devaki-putra?:</i>]]> &quot;&quot;The son of Devaki, K???a, is the Supreme Personality.&quot;&quot; (<bd-><![CDATA[<i>Naraya?a Upani?ad<bd></bd></i>]]> 4) Then it is said, <![CDATA[<i>eko vai naraya?a asin na brahma na isano napo nagni-somau neme dyav-ap?thivi na nak?atra?i na surya?:</i>]]> &quot;&quot;In the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality Naraya?a. There was no Brahma, no Siva, no water, no fire, no moon, no heaven and earth, no stars in the sky, no sun.&quot;&quot; (<bd-><![CDATA[<i>Maha Upani?ad<bd></bd></i>]]> 1.2) In the <![CDATA[<i>Maha Upani?ad</i>]]> it is also said that Lord Siva was born from the forehead of the Supreme Lord. Thus the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of Brahma and Siva, who is to be worshiped.<p>
                    <p>
                      In the <![CDATA[<i>Mok?a-dharma</i>]]> section of the <![CDATA[<i>Mahabharata</i>]]>, K???a also says,

                      &quot;&quot;The patriarchs, Siva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy.&quot;&quot; In the <![CDATA[<i>Varaha Pura?a</i>]]> it is also said,
                    </p>

                      sa ca sarva-jñata? gata?
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;&quot;Naraya?a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahma was born, from whom Siva was born.&quot;&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                      Lord K???a is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient cause of everything. He says, &quot;&quot;Because everything is born of Me, I am the original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.&quot;&quot; There is no supreme controller other than K???a. One who understands K???a in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master, with references from Vedic literature, engages all his energy in K???a consciousness and becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not know K???a properly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider K???a to be an ordinary man. A K???a conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and proceed in K???a consciousness with determination and firmness.

    <p>Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of K???a. Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in K???a, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.</p>
    <p>
      In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V?ndavana, the supreme planet of K???a. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K???a and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the <![CDATA[<i><it>Caitanya-caritam?ta</it></i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i>Madhya-lila<it>,</it></i>]]> Chapter Nineteen). It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> is also full of such narrations about the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> is very dear to the devotees, as stated in the <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavatam</i>]]> itself (12.13.18). <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-bhagavata? pura?am amala? yad vai??avana? priyam.</i>]]> In this narration there is nothing about material activities, economic development, sense gratification or liberation. <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in K???a consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association.
    </p>

<slokas chapter="10" sloka="10">
    <p>
      In this verse the word <![CDATA[<i>buddhi-yogam</i>]]> is very significant. We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of <![CDATA[<i>buddhi-yoga.</i>]]> Now <![CDATA[<i>buddhi-yoga</i>]]> is explained. <![CDATA[<i>Buddhi-yoga</i>]]> itself is action in K???a consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. <![CDATA[<i>Buddhi</i>]]> means intelligence, and <![CDATA[<i>yoga</i>]]> means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to K???a consciousness in devotional service, his action is called <![CDATA[<i>buddhi yoga.</i>]]> In other words, <![CDATA[<i>buddhi-yoga</i>]]> is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is K???a. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that the goal is K???a, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is acting in <![CDATA[<i>karma-yoga.</i>]]> When he knows that the goal is K???a but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand K???a, he is acting in <![CDATA[<i>jñana-yoga.</i>]]> And when he knows the goal and seeks K???a completely in K???a consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> or <![CDATA[<i>buddhi-yoga,</i>]]> which is the complete <![CDATA[<i>yoga.</i>]]> This complete <![CDATA[<i>yoga</i>]]> is the highest perfectional stage of life.
    </p>
    <p>A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but if he is still not intelligent enough to make progress, then K???a from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person always engage himself in K???a consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for K???a, and that work should be with love. If a devotee is not intelligent enough to make progress on the path of self-realization but is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him. </p>

  <slokas chapter="10" sloka="11">
    <p>
      When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prakasananda Sarasvati, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes Mayavadi philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion. But even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by K???a Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K???a consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full K???a consciousness.
      <p>The Mayavadi philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.</p>
      <p>The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand K???a, or the Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, K???a, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has K???a within his heart; and with the presence of K???a, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignorance is at once dissipated. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by K???a.</p>
      <p>
        Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one''s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare K???a, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal, Vi??u, can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about the material necessities of life; he need not be anxious, because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, who is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is the essence of the teachings of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> By studying <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> one can become a soul completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors.

    <p>
      Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot understand K???a. He is not known even by the demigods, so what to speak of the so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is K???a and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> As described in the Fourth Chapter, the <![CDATA[<i>parampara</i>]]> system of disciplic succession for the understanding of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> was lost, and therefore K???a reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to <![CDATA[<i>Gitopani?ad, Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> should be understood in the <![CDATA[<i>parampara</i>]]> system. When the <![CDATA[<i>parampara</i>]]> system was lost, Arjuna was selected to rejuvenate it. The acceptance by Arjuna of all that K???a says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> and then only can we understand that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="10" sloka="15">
    <p>
      The Supreme Lord, K???a, can be known by persons who are in a relationship with Him through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna and his followers. Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know K???a. Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not know K???a should not try to comment on <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is the statement of K???a, and since it is the science of K???a, it should be understood from K???a as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from atheistic persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated in <![CDATA[<i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.2.11):<p>
          <p>
            vadanti tat tattva-vidas<br/>
            tattva? yaj jñanam advayam<br/>

          </p>
          <p>
            The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A common man or even a liberated man who has realized impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma may not understand God''s personality. Such men, therefore, may endeavor to understand the Supreme Person from the verses of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> which are being spoken by this person, K???a. Sometimes the impersonalists accept K???a as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand K???a as Puru?ottama, the Supreme Person. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puru?ottama. Yet one still may not understand that K???a is the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as <it>Bhuta-bhavana. <it>
                And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as <it>Bhutesa<it>, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows K???a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as <it>Devadeva<it>, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth about K???a is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K???a as He is. <p></p>

    <p>
      In this verse it appears that Arjuna is already satisfied with his understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. By K???a''s grace, Arjuna has personal experience, intelligence and knowledge and whatever else a person may have, and through all these agencies he has understood K???a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For him there is no doubt, yet he is asking K???a to explain His all-pervading nature. People in general and the impersonalists in particular concern themselves mainly with the all-pervading nature of the Supreme. So Arjuna is asking K???a how He exists in His all-pervading aspect through His different energies. One should know that this is being asked by Arjuna on behalf of the common people.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="10" sloka="17">
    <p>
      As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is covered by His <![CDATA[<i><it>yoga-maya<it>.</it></it></i>]]> Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, K???a, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man. Common men, including the demons and atheists, cannot know K???a, because He is guarded by His <![CDATA[<i>yoga-maya</i>]]> energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding but for the understanding of all mankind. So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because he is a Vai??ava, a devotee, is opening for the common man the understanding of the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord. He addresses K???a specifically as <![CDATA[<i>yogin</i>]]> because Sri K???a is the master of the <![CDATA[<i>yoga-maya</i>]]> energy, by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no love for K???a cannot always think of K???a; therefore he has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world. The words <![CDATA[<i>ke?u ke?u ca bhave?u</i>]]> refer to material nature (the word <![CDATA[<i>bhava</i>]]> means &quot;&quot;physical things&quot;&quot;). Because materialists cannot understand K???a spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how K???a is manifested by physical representations.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="10" sloka="18">
    <p>
      A similar statement was made to Suta Gosvami by the <![CDATA[<i>??is</i>]]> of Naimi?ara?ya, headed by Saunaka. That statement is:
    </p>
    <p>
      vaya? tu na vit?pyama<br/>
      uttama-sloka-vikrame<br/>
      yac ch??vata? rasa-jñana?<br/>
      svadu svadu pade pade
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;&quot;One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental pastimes of K???a, who is glorified by excellent prayers. Those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with K???a relish at every step the descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord.&quot;&quot; (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]>
      1.1.19) Thus Arjuna is interested in hearing about K???a, and specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as far as <![CDATA[<i>am?tam,</i>]]> nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning K???a is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories but one never tires of hearing about K???a. It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. The <![CDATA[<i>Pura?as</i>]]> are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.
    </p>

  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="10" sloka="19">
    <p>
      It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of K???a and His opulences. The senses of the individual soul are limited and do not permit him to understand the totality of K???a''s affairs. Still the devotees try to understand K???a, but not on the principle that they will be able to understand K???a fully at any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of K???a are so relishable that they appear to the devotees as nectar. Thus the devotees enjoy them. In discussing K???a''s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. K???a knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different energies. The word <![CDATA[<i>pradhanyata?</i>]]> (&quot;&quot;principal&quot;&quot;) is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And <![CDATA[<i>vibhuti,</i>]]> as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation. In the <![CDATA[<i>Amara-kosa</i>]]> dictionary it is stated that <![CDATA[<i>vibhuti</i>]]> indicates an exceptional opulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impersonalist or pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energies. Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation. Now K???a is describing what can be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="10" sloka="20">
    <p>In this verse Arjuna is addressed as Gu?akesa, which means &quot;&quot;one who has conquered the darkness of sleep.&quot;&quot; For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance, it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests Himself in various ways in the material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by K???a to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences.
    </p>
    <p>
      K???a first informs Arjuna that He is the soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the <![CDATA[<i>puru?a</i>]]> incarnations, and from Him everything begins. Therefore He is <![CDATA[<i>atma,</i>]]> the soul of the <![CDATA[<i>mahat-tattva,</i>]]> the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the creation; actually Maha-vi??u enters into the <![CDATA[<i>mahat-tattva,</i>]]> the total material energy. He is the soul. When Maha-vi??u enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul, K???a, enters. As stated in the <![CDATA[<i>Subala Upani?ad,</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>prak?ty-adi-sarva-bhutantar-yami sarva-se?i ca naraya?a?:</i>]]> &quot;&quot;The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all manifested universes.&quot;&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The three <![CDATA[<i>puru?a-avataras</i>]]> are described in <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam.</i>]]> They are also described in the Narada-pancaratra, one of the <![CDATA[<i>Satvata-tantras.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i><it>Vi??os tu tri?i rupa?i puru?akhyany atho vidu?<it>:</it></it></i>]]> the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three features—as Kara?odakasayi Vi??u, Garbhodakasayi Vi??u and K?irodakasayi Vi??u—in this material manifestation. The Maha-vi??u, or Kara?odakasayi Vi??u, is described in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]>(5.47). <![CDATA[<i>Ya? kara?ar?ava-jale bhajati sma yoga-nidram:</i>]]> the Supreme Lord, K???a, the cause of all causes, lies down in the cosmic ocean as Maha-vi??u. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal manifestations, and the end of all energy. 
    </p>

<slokas chapter="10" sloka="21">

      There are twelve Adityas, of which K???a is the principal. Among all the luminaries shining in the sky, the sun is the chief, and in the <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> the sun is accepted as the glowing eye of the Supreme Lord. There are fifty varieties of wind blowing in space, and of these winds the controlling deity, Marici, represents K???a.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the stars, the moon is the most prominent at night, and thus the moon represents K???a. It appears from this verse that the moon is one of the stars; therefore the stars that twinkle in the sky also reflect the light of the sun. The theory that there are many suns within the universe is not accepted by Vedic literature. The sun is one, and as by the reflection of the sun the moon illuminates, so also do the stars. Since <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> indicates herein that the moon is one of the stars, the twinkling stars are not suns but are similar to the moon.

Vasudeva is K???a''s immediate expansion, so Vasudeva is not different from K???a. It is to be understood that the Vasudeva referred to in this verse of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is Baladeva, or Balarama, because He is the original source of all incarnations and thus He is the sole source of Vasudeva.

      There is a Mission that regularly propounds that worship of any demigod will lead one to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the supreme goal. But worship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahma and Siva represent only part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is <![CDATA[<i>asamaurdhva,</i>]]> which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In the <![CDATA[<i>Padma Pura?a</i>]]> it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K???a in the same category with demigods—be they even Brahma or Siva—becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of K???a''s energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord Sri K???a and can fix his mind in the worship of K???a without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K???a consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of K???a are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight through eleven. That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter. Srila Baladeva Vidyabhu?a?a, a great <![CDATA[<i>acarya</i>]]> in disciplic succession from K???a, concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying,
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>This chapter reveals K???a as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause of the Maha-vi??u, from whom the material universes emanate. K???a is not an incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely explained in the last chapter.</p>
    <p>Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of K???a as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has such a great friend as K???a, but now he is thinking that although he may accept K???a as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to establish K???a''s divinity for all, he is requesting K???a in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K???a one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K???a is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what K???a has several times said: K???a is speaking to him just for his benefit. So Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by K???a''s grace. He is now convinced that K???a is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone&quot;&quot;s heart as the Supersoul.</p>
  </slokas>
<slokas chapter="11" sloka="2">
    <p>
      Arjuna addresses Lord K???a as "lotus-eyed" (K???a''s eyes appear just like the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for K???a has assured him, in a previous chapter, <![CDATA[<i><it>aha? k?tsnasya jagata? prabhava? pralayas tatha<it>:</it></it></i>]]> "I am the source of the appearance and disappearance of this entire material manifestation." Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and disappearances, He is aloof from them. As the Lord has said in the Ninth Chapter, He is all-pervading, yet He is not personally present everywhere. That is the inconceivable opulence of K???a which Arjuna admits that he has thoroughly understood.
    </p>
  </slokas>
<slokas chapter="11" sloka="3">
    <p>
      The Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on. Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of K???a, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that K???a is an ordinary person, Arjuna desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it. Arjuna''s addressing the Lord as <![CDATA[<i><it>puru?ottama</it></i>]]> is also significant. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for Arjuna is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of K???a. But the Lord can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others. Arjuna did not have any personal desire for confirmation. K???a also understands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be K???a should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="4">
    <p>
      It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme Lord, K???a, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges K???a''s inestimable position. Arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word <![CDATA[<i>yogesvara</i>]]> is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of K???a. He does not give K???a orders. K???a is not obliged to reveal Himself unless one surrenders fully in K???a consciousness and engages in devotional service. Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see K???a.
    </p>
  </slokas>
<slokas chapter="11" sloka="5">
    <p>Arjuna wanted to see K???a in His universal form, which, although a transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the material nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form of K???a is manifested and nonmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like K???a''s other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see K???a in this way, K???a reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any ordinary man. K???a must give one the power to see it.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="6">
    <p>Even though Arjuna was a personal friend of K???a and the most advanced of learned men, it was still not possible for him to know everything about K???a. Here it is stated that humans have neither heard nor known of all these forms and manifestations. Now K???a reveals these wonderful forms.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="7">
    <p>No one can see the entire universe while sitting in one place. Even the most advanced scientist cannot see what is going on in other parts of the universe. But a devotee like Arjuna can see everything that exists in any part of the universe. K???a gives him the power to see anything he wants to see, past, present and future. Thus by the mercy of K???a, Arjuna is able to see everything. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="8">
    <p>A pure devotee does not like to see K???a in any form except His form with two hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of K???a, Arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision. The universal form of K???a is not very important; that will be clear in subsequent verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form.</p>
    <p>
      Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K???a are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The playmates of K???a, the friends of K???a and the parents of K???a never want K???a to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that K???a is the Supreme Lord. In the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> it is stated that the boys who play with K???a are all highly pious souls and after many, many births they are able to play with K???a. Such boys do not know that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend. Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami recites this verse:
    </p>
    <p>
      ittha? sata? brahma-sukhanubhutya<br/>
      dasya? gatana? para-daivatena<br/>
      mayasritana? nara-darake?a<br/>
      saka? vijahru? k?ta-pu?ya-puñja?
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;&quot;Here is the Supreme Person, who is considered the impersonal Brahman by great sages, the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotees, and a product of material nature by ordinary men. Now these boys, who have performed many, many pious activities in their past lives, are playing with that Supreme Personality of Godhead.&quot;&quot; (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>10.12.11)<p></p>
        <p>
          The fact is that the devotee is not concerned with seeing the <![CDATA[<i>visva-rupa,</i>]]> the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate K???a''s statements so that in the future people could understand that K???a not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the <![CDATA[<i>parampara</i>]]> system. Those who are actually interested in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K???a not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.
        </p>
        <p>

Thus he now compares the situation, as far as it can be understood, to an imaginable phenomenon (i.e., thousands of suns). </p>

  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="13">
    <p>
      The word <![CDATA[<i>tatra</i>]]> ("there") is very significant. It indicates that both Arjuna and K???a were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form. Others on the battlefield could not see this form, because K???a gave the vision only to Arjuna. Arjuna could see in the body of K???a many thousands of planets. As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see all these. But no one could understand what was going on between Arjuna and K???a.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="14">
    <p>Once the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between K???a and Arjuna changes immediately. Before, K???a and Arjuna had a relationship based on friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering obeisances with great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to K???a. He is praising the universal form. Thus Arjuna''s relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship. Great devotees see K???a as the reservoir of all relationships. In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in K???a. It is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.</p>
    <p>Here Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was affected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="15">
    <p>Arjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees Brahma, who is the first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the Garbhodakasayi Vi??u lies in the lower regions of the universe. This snake bed is called Vasuki. There are also other snakes known as Vasuki. Arjuna can see from the Garbhodakasayi Vi??u up to the topmost part of the universe on the lotus-flower planet where Brahma, the first creature of the universe, resides. That means that from the beginning to the end, everything could be seen by Arjuna, who was sitting in one place on his chariot. This was possible by the grace of the Supreme Lord, K???a.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="16">
    <p>K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is unlimited; thus through Him everything could be seen.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="19">
    <p>There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here and in many other places there is repetition, but according to the scriptures, repetition of the glories of K???a is not a literary weakness. It is said that at a time of bewilderment or wonder or of great ecstasy, statements are repeated over and over. That is not a flaw. </p>

      <![CDATA[<i>Dyav a-p?thivyo?</i>]]> ("the space between heaven and earth") and <![CDATA[<i>loka-trayam</i>]]> ("the three worlds") are significant words in this verse because it appears that not only did Arjuna see this universal form of the Lord, but others in other planetary systems saw it also. Arjuna''s seeing of the universal form was not a dream. All whom the Lord endowed with divine vision saw that universal form on the battlefield.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="21">
    <p>The demigods in all the planetary systems feared the terrific manifestation of the universal form and its glaring effulgence and so prayed for protection.

<slokas chapter="11" sloka="33">
    <p>
      <![CDATA[<i>Savya-sacin</i>]]> refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field; thus Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill his enemies. "Just become an instrument": <![CDATA[<i>nimitta-matram.</i>]]> This word is also very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of "perhaps" and "maybe." There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long as they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivate K???a consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the Battle of Kuruk?etra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight in accordance with the desire of the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in full K???a consciousness and his life is devoted to the Lord''s transcendental service, he is perfect.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="34">
    <p>Every plan is made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is so kind and merciful to His devotees that He wants to give the credit to His devotees who carry out His plan according to His desire. Life should therefore move in such a way that everyone acts in K???a consciousness and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the medium of a spiritual master. The plans of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are understood by His mercy, and the plans of the devotees are as good as His plans. One should follow such plans and be victorious in the struggle for existence. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="35">
    <p>As we have already explained, because of the situation created by the universal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna became bewildered in wonder; thus he began to offer his respectful obeisances to K???a again and again, and with faltering voice he began to pray, not as a friend, but as a devotee in wonder. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="36">
    <p>
      Arjuna, after hearing from K???a about the outcome of the Battle of Kuruk?etra, became enlightened, and as a great devotee and friend of the Supreme Personality of Godhead he said that everything done by K???a is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that K???a is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables. His actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the Battle of Kuruk?etra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many demigods, <![CDATA[<i>siddhas,</i>]]> and the intelligentsia of the higher planets, and they were observing the fight because K???a was present there. When Arjuna saw the universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled. K???a''s treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He does is good for all.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="37">
    <p>
      By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that K???a is worshipable by everyone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is addressing K???a as <![CDATA[<i>mahatma,</i>]]> which means that He is most magnanimous and unlimited. <![CDATA[<i>Ananta</i>]]> indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and <![CDATA[<i>devesa</i>]]> means that He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the shelter of the whole universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him, because no one is greater than Him. Arjuna especially mentions that K???a is greater than Brahma because Brahma is created by Him. Brahma is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodakasayi Vi??u, who is K???a''s plenary expansion; therefore Brahma and Lord Siva, who is born of Brahma, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. It is stated in <![CDATA[<i><it>Srimad-Bhagavatam</it></i>]]>that the Lord is respected by Lord Siva and Brahma and similar other demigods. The word <![CDATA[<i>ak?aram</i>]]> is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme.</p>
</slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="38">
    <p>
      Everything is resting on the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is the ultimate rest. <![CDATA[<i>Nidhanam</i>]]> means that everything, even the Brahman effulgence, rests on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. He is the knower of everything that is happening in this world, and if knowledge has any end, He is the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the knowable. He is the object of knowledge because He is all-pervading. Because He is the cause in the spiritual world, He is transcendental. He is also the chief personality in the transcendental world.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="39">
    <p>The Lord is addressed here as air because the air is the most important representation of all the demigods, being all-pervasive. Arjuna also addresses K???a as the great-grandfather because He is the father of Brahma, the first living creature in the universe.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="40">
    <p>
      Out of loving ecstasy for K???a, his friend, Arjuna is offering his respects from all sides. He is accepting that He is the master of all potencies and all prowess and far superior to all the great warriors assembled on the battlefield. It is said in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Vi??u Pura?a</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.9.69):<p></p>
        <p>
          yo ''ya? tavagato deva<br/>
          samipa? devata-ga?a?<br/>
          sa tvam eva jagat-sra??a<br/>
          yata? sarva-gato bhavan
        </p>
        <p>"Whoever comes before You, even if he be a demigod, is created by You, O Supreme Personality of Godhead." </p>
      </bd>
    </p>
    </slokas>
<slokas chapter="11" sloka="43">
    <p>
      The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahma and presently He is also instructing <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from K???a. Without being a representative of K???a, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, because no one is equal to or higher than K???a within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him. This is stated in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(6.8):<p>
        <p>
          na tasya karya? kara?a? ca vidyate<br/>
          na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca d?syate
        </p>
        <p>The Supreme Lord, K???a, has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, His body, His mind and Himself. Foolish persons who do not perfectly know Him say that K???a is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. K???a is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that although He does not have senses like ours, He can perform all sensory activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.</p>
        <p>
          The knowledge, strength and activities of the Supreme Personality are all transcendental. As stated in <![CDATA[<i><bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(4.9):<p></p>
            <p>
              janma karma ca me divyam<br/>
              eva? yo vetti tattvata?<br/>
              tyaktva deha? punar janma<br/>
              naiti mam eti so ''rjuna
            </p>
            <p>
              Whoever knows K???a''s transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn''t come back again to this miserable world. Therefore one should know that K???a''s activities are different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of K???a; that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is master of K???a; everyone is His servant. The <![CDATA[<i>Caitanya-caritam?ta</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Adi</bd-></i>]]><bd>5.142) confirms, <![CDATA[<i>ekale isvara k???a, ara saba bh?tya:</i>]]> only K???a is God, and everyone else is His servant. Everyone is complying with His order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under His superintendence. As stated in the <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sa?hita,</i>]]> He is the cause of all causes.</bd>
            </p>

  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="44">
    <p>K???a''s devotees relate to K???a in various relationships; one might treat K???a as a son, or one might treat K???a as a husband, as a friend, or as a master. K???a and Arjuna are related in friendship. As the father tolerates, or the husband or a master tolerates, so K???a tolerates. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="45">
    <p>Arjuna is always in confidence with K???a because he is a very dear friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend''s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K???a out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K???a to show His Naraya?a form, because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku??ha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as Naraya?a. There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K???a is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaiku??ha planets. Of course in each Vaiku??ha planet the form of Naraya?a is four-handed, but the four hands hold different arrangements of symbols—the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four things are held in, the Naraya?as are variously named. All of these forms are one with K???a; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="46">
    <p>
      In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]>(5.39) it is stated, <![CDATA[<i>ramadi-murti?u kala-niyamena ti??han:</i>]]> the Lord is eternally situated in hundreds and thousands of forms, and the main forms are those like Rama, N?si?ha, Naraya?a, etc. There are innumerable forms. But Arjuna knew that K???a is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His temporary universal form. He is now asking to see the form of Naraya?a, a spiritual form. This verse establishes without any doubt the statement of the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> that K???a is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features originate from Him. He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is God in any of His innumerable forms. In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man. That is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who knows K???a becomes free at once from all contamination of the material world.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="47">
    <p>Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so Lord K???a, out of His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, showed His universal form, full of effulgence and opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were rapidly changing. K???a showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by K???a through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it. They had not seen it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of K???a. Someone has commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when K???a went to Duryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace offer, but at that time K???a manifested some of His universal forms. But those forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna. It is clearly said that no one had ever seen this form before. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="48">
    <p>
      The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi??u are demigods (<![CDATA[<i>vi??u-bhakta? sm?ta deva?</i>]]>). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi??u, or who recognize only the impersonal part of K???a as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry K???a and at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> gives the description of the universal form. Although this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have some idea of the <![CDATA[<i>visva-rupa</i>]]> after this incident. Those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of K???a. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested in seeing the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord K???a as Vi??u, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this verse there are some significant words, just like <![CDATA[<i>veda-yajñadhyayanai?,</i>]]> which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations. <![CDATA[<i>Veda</i>]]> refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, such as the four <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i>?g, Yajur, Sama</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Atharva</i>]]>) and the eighteen <![CDATA[<i>Pura?as,</i>]]> the <![CDATA[<i>Upani?ads</i>]]> and the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra.</i>]]> One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are <![CDATA[<i>sutras-Kalpa-sutras</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Mima?sa-sutras</i>]]>—for studying the method of sacrifice. <![CDATA[<i>Danai?</i>]]> refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord—the <![CDATA[<i>brahma?as</i>]]> and the Vai??avas. Similarly, "pious activities" refers to the <![CDATA[<i>agni-hotra</i>]]> and the prescribed duties of the different castes. And the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains is called <![CDATA[<i>tapasya.</i>]]> So one can perform all these—can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> etc.—but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the principles of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that it enables one to distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is unacceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of K???a one cannot see the universal form of God. So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of K???a; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K???a cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="49">
    <p>
      In the beginning of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> Arjuna was worried about killing Bhi?ma and Dro?a, his worshipful grandfather and master. But K???a said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather. When the sons of Dh?tara??ra tried to disrobe Draupadi in the assembly of the Kurus, Bhi?ma and Dro?a were silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed. K???a showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful and they cannot perform such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and K???a showed him. A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings. Either a devotee wants to offer his respectful worshipful feelings, or he wants to see the two-handed K???a form so that he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="50">
    <p>
      When K???a appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, He first of all appeared as four-armed Naraya?a, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child in appearance. Similarly, K???a knew that Arjuna was not interested in seeing a four-handed form, but since Arjuna asked to see this four-handed form, K???a also showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two-handed form. The word <![CDATA[<i>saumya-vapu?</i>]]> is very significant. <![CDATA[<i>Saumya-vapu?</i>]]> is a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form. When He was present, everyone was attracted simply by K???a''s form, and because K???a is the director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His devotee, and showed him again His beautiful form of K???a. In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]>(5.38) it is stated, <![CDATA[<i>premañjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena:</i>]]> only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form of Sri K???a. </p>    
  </slokas>
<slokas chapter="11" sloka="51">
    <p>
      Here the words <![CDATA[<i>manu?a? rupam</i>]]> clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be originally two-handed. Those who deride K???a as if He were an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If K???a is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed Naraya?a form? So it is very clearly stated in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> that one who thinks that K???a is an ordinary person and who misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within K???a speaking is doing the greatest injustice. K???a has actually shown His universal form and His four-handed Vi??u form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> because he knows what is what. The original verses of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> are as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="52">
    <p>
      In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K???a concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many pious activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word <![CDATA[<i>su-durdarsam</i>]]> is used, indicating that K???a''s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of K???a by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances, Vedic study and philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but without a tinge of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti</i>]]> one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the form of K???a with two hands is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahma and Lord Siva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidence in the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devaki, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of K???a, and they offered nice prayers to the Lord, although He was not at that time visible to them. They waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to Him but to the impersonal "something" within Him, but these are all nonsensical postures. K???a in His two-armed form is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahma and Siva.<p></p>
      <p>
        In <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita<bd></bd></i>]]> (9.11) it is also confirmed, <![CDATA[<i>avajananti ma? mu?ha manu?i? tanum asritam:</i>]]> He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K???a''s body, as confirmed by <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sa?hita</i>]]> and confirmed by K???a Himself in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of K???a by reading <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> or similar Vedic scriptures, K???a is a problem. For one using a material process, K???a is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He was so powerful He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on K???a and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K???a which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> Chapter Four: to hear about K???a from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about K???a from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, K???a becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K???a is covered by His <![CDATA[<i>yoga-maya</i>]]> potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K???a consciousness and by devotional service to K???a, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see K???a by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand K???a, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K???a in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of K???a is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as Syamasundara.

    <p>K???a first appeared before His parents Devaki and Vasudeva in a four-handed form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form. This mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of devotional service. For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way of grammatical knowledge or mere academic qualifications, K???a is not possible to understand. Nor is He to be understood by persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship. They make their visit, but they cannot understand K???a as He is. K???a can be understood only through the path of devotional service, as explained by K???a Himself in the next verse. </p>
                        </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="11" sloka="54">
    <p>
      K???a can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators, who try to understand <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K???a or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. These things are very difficult to understand by study of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it is clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K???a, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For example, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on Janma??ami, the day on which K???a appeared, and on the two days of Ekadasi (the eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon). As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K???a who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K???a philosophy, or K???a consciousness, throughout the world. K???a consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by Rupa Gosvami as the most munificent man of charity because love of K???a, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributing K???a consciousness, that charity, given to spread K???a consciousness, is the greatest charity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi??u or K???a), that is a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>6.23):<p>
          <p>
            yasya deve para bhaktir<br/>

            [<![CDATA[<i><bd->SU</bd-></i>]]><bd><p><p> One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. One cannot understand K???a by mental speculation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K???a. The word <![CDATA[<i>tu</i>]]> is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K???a.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The personal forms of K???a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are described as <it>su-durdarsam<it>, very difficult to see. They are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form of Naraya?a and the two-handed form of K???a are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The words <it>tvad anyena na d???a-purvam<it>(Text 47) state that before Arjuna no one had seen that universal form. Also, they suggest that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K???a at the request of Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.<p>
                              <p>
                                The word <![CDATA[<i>na,</i>]]> used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one should not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in Vedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of K???a. Only then can one attempt to write commentaries on <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                K???a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of Naraya?a and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K???a. He is the origin of all emanations. K???a is distinct even from these forms, what to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K???a are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K???a (which is known as Maha-vi??u, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.48),<p>
                                    <p>

Therefore I worship Govinda, K???a, the cause of all causes." Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K???a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who has eternal bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi??u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]>

                                                          Elsewhere it is said, <![CDATA[<i>yatravatir?a? k???akhya? para? brahma narak?ti:</i>]]> "The Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, His name is K???a, and He sometimes descends on this earth." Similarly, in the <![CDATA[<i><it>Srimad-Bhagavatam</it></i>]]> <it>we find a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in this list the name of K???a also appears. But then it is said that this K???a is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself (<![CDATA[<i><it>ete ca?sa-kala? pu?sa? k???as tu bhagavan svayam</it></i>]]><it>).<p>
                                                                <p>
                                                                  Similarly, in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> the Lord says, <![CDATA[<i><it>matta? paratara? nanyat<it>:</it></it></i>]]> "There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K???a." He also says elsewhere in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i><it>aham adir hi devanam<it>:</it></it></i>]]> "I am the origin of all the demigods." And after understanding <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> from K???a, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: <![CDATA[<i><it>para? brahma para? dhama pavitram-parama? bhavan<it>,</it></it></i>]]> "I now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything." Therefore the universal form which K???a showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K???a form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God''s original form.
                                                                </p>
                                                                <p>The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K???a. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K???a in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who was a constant companion of K???a''s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the two-handed form of K???a is the most dear. </p>

    <p>
      Anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the K???aloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, K???a, must take this formula, as stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K???a conscious activities. As stated in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Bhakti-rasam?ta-sindhu</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.2.255),<p>
          <p>
            anasaktasya vi?ayan<br/>
            yatharham upayuñjata?<br/>
            nirbandha? k???a-sambandhe<br/>
            yukta? vairagyam ucyate
          </p>
          <p>
            No work should be done by any man except in relationship to K???a. This is called <![CDATA[<i>k???a-karma.</i>]]> One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K???a consciousness, one has to do business for K???a. If K???a is the proprietor of the business, then K???a should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K???a, he can do it. This is work for K???a. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K???a, and he can install the Deity of K???a and arrange for the Deity''s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all <![CDATA[<i>k???a-karma.</i>]]> One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K???a, and one should accept as <![CDATA[<i>prasadam</i>]]> the remnants of offerings to K???a. If one constructs a very big building for K???a and installs the Deity of K???a, one is not prohibited from living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is K???a. That is called K???a consciousness. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K???a, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K???a; that is also <![CDATA[<i>k???a-karma.</i>]]> One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land—in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land—can utilize that for K???a by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sow <![CDATA[<i>tulasi</i>]]> plants, because <![CDATA[<i>tulasi</i>]]> leaves are very important and K???a has recommended this in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i><it>Patra? pu?pa? phala? toyam<it>.</it></it></i>]]><it>
              <it>
                K???a desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water—and by such an offering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the <![CDATA[<i>tulasi.</i>]]> So one can sow <![CDATA[<i>tulasi</i>]]> and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K???a. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K???a.<p>
                  <p>
                    The word <![CDATA[<i>mat-parama?</i>]]> refers to one who considers the association of K???a in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K???aloka, Goloka V?ndavana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word <![CDATA[<i>mad-bhakta?,</i>]]> he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The term <![CDATA[<i>sa?ga-varjita?</i>]]> is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K???a. Not only are the atheistic persons against K???a, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in <![CDATA[<i><bd->Bhakti-rasam?ta-sindhu</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.1.11) as follows:<p>
                        <p>
                          anyabhila?ita-sunya?<br/>
                          jñana-karmady-anav?tam<br/>
                          anukulyena k???anu-<br/>
                          silana? bhaktir uttama<br/>
                          <it->
                          [<it>Cc. Madhya 19.167<it->]<it>
                                  <p>
                                    <p>
                                      In this verse Srila Rupa Gosvami clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K???a, that is called pure devotional service. <![CDATA[<i>Anukulyasya sa?kalpa? pratikulyasya varjanam</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Hari-bhakti-vilasa</bd-></i>]]><bd>11.676). One should think of K???a and act for K???a favorably, not unfavorably. Ka?sa was an enemy of K???a''s. From the very beginning of K???a''s birth, Ka?sa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K???a. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K???a conscious in every respect, but that K???a consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K???a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K???a at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K???a attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V?ndavana. His only objective is to serve K???a wherever he may be.<p>
                                          <p>
                                            A devotee of K???a is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy (<![CDATA[<i>nirvaira?</i>]]>). How is this? A devotee situated in K???a consciousness knows that only devotional service to K???a can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K???a consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as ?hakura Haridasa and Prahlada Maharaja. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K???a consciousness, and it is difficult. A K???a conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K???a. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one''s neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K???a is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            In summary, the universal form of K???a, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi??u, four-handed, have all been exhibited by K???a. Thus K???a is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that K???a is a manifestation of the original <![CDATA[<i>visva-rupa,</i>]]> or Vi??u. K???a is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi??us, but for a devotee no form of K???a is important but the original form, two-handed Syamasundara. In the <![CDATA[<i><it>Brahma-sa?hita</it></i>]]> <it>it is stated that those who are attached to the Syamasundara form of K???a in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of K???a is essential and supreme. <p></p>
                                              <p>
                                                Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the Srimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of the Universal Form.

    <p>
      K???a has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and <![CDATA[<i>yogis.</i>]]> Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist also engages himself, not directly in the service of K???a but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth, <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> devotional service, is the highest. If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but K???a indicates in this chapter that <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> or devotional service to Him, is the highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Second Chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> the Supreme Lord explained that a living entity is not the material body; he is a spiritual spark. And the Absolute Truth is the spiritual whole. In the Seventh Chapter He spoke of the living entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. Then again in the Eighth Chapter it was said that anyone who thinks of K???a at the time of quitting his body is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to the abode of K???a. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord clearly said that of all <![CDATA[<i>yogis,</i>]]> one who always thinks of K???a within himself is considered the most perfect. So in practically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached to the personal form of K???a, for that is the highest spiritual realization.<p></p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of K???a. They are so firmly detached that even in the preparation of commentaries to <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> they want to distract other people from K???a and transfer all devotion to the impersonal <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir.</i>]]> They prefer to meditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the reach of the senses and is not manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is trying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes is most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of K???a. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, "What is the use of such a waste of time?" Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K???a is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for K???a. This important question asked of K???a by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth.
      </p>
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="2">
    <p>
      In answer to Arjuna''s question, K???a clearly says that he who concentrates upon His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be considered most perfect in <![CDATA[<i>yoga.</i>]]> For one in such K???a consciousness there are no material activities, because everything is done for K???a. A pure devotee is constantly engaged. Sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about K???a, or sometimes he cooks <![CDATA[<i>prasadam</i>]]> or goes to the marketplace to purchase something for K???a, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes—whatever he does, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to K???a. Such action is in full <![CDATA[<i><it>samadhi<it>.</it></it></i>]]>
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="5">
    <p>
      The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called <![CDATA[<i>jñana-yogis,</i>]]> and persons who are in full K???a consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yogis.</i>]]> Now, here the difference between <![CDATA[<i>jñana-yoga</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> is definitely expressed. The process of <![CDATA[<i>jñana-yoga,</i>]]> although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yogi</i>]]> accepts the Deity of K???a as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be <![CDATA[<i>sagu?a</i>]]> or <![CDATA[<i>nirgu?a</i>]]>—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is <![CDATA[<i>sagu?a</i>]]> worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation which we may find somewhere but which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called <![CDATA[<i><it>arca-vigraha<it>.</it></it></i>]]> This <![CDATA[<i>arca-vigraha</i>]]> is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as <![CDATA[<i>arca-vigraha</i>]]> He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life.<p></p>
      <p>
        So for a devotee there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the <![CDATA[<i>Upani?ads,</i>]]> and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in K???a consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar passage appears in <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam.</i>]]> It is stated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called <![CDATA[<i>bhakti</i>]]>), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization, because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.
      </p>
      <p>
        A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of <![CDATA[<i>jñana-yoga,</i>]]> may come to the point of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of K???a consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus the process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by Lord K???a.
      </p>
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="8">
    <p>
      One who is engaged in Lord K???a''s devotional service lives in a direct relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on the material plane—he lives in K???a. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare K???a, K???a and His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he offers K???a food, K???a directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes K???a-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and in other Vedic literatures.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="9">
    <p>
      In this verse, two different processes of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> are indicated. The first applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to K???a.
    </p>
    <p>
      <![CDATA[<i>Bhakti-yoga</i>]]> is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification. But by the practice of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> these senses can become purified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don''t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses.
    </p>
    <p>This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone''s heart. And, there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material association. Now the heart has to be purified of the material association, and that dormant, natural love for K???a has to be revived. That is the whole process.</p>
    <p>
      To practice the regulative principles of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]> one should, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and chant Hare K???a, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take <![CDATA[<i>prasadam,</i>]]> and so on. There are various rules and regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> from pure devotees. This practice can help anyone rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> under the rules and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one to the stage of love of God. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="10">
    <p>
      One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One should be sympathetic to the propagation of K???a consciousness. There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of K???a consciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulative principles of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization and labor. Just as in business one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of K???a. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of K???a, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating K???a consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot sacrifice the results of his activities, the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagate K???a consciousness. This voluntary service to the cause of K???a consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="11">
    <p>
      It may be that one is unable even to sympathize with the activities of K???a consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because of some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of K???a consciousness, there may be objections from family members, or so many other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions for the full-moon day, and there is special work in which the result of one''s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of K???a consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one''s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand K???a consciousness. Of course, K???a consciousness is not dependent on any other experience, because K???a consciousness itself can purify one''s mind, but if there are impediments to accepting K???a consciousness, one may try to give up the results of his actions. In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacrifice for one''s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In <![CDATA[<i><bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]>(18.46) we find it is stated, <![CDATA[<i>yata? prav?ttir bhutanam:</i>]]> if one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause is K???a, he will come gradually to understand that K???a is the supreme cause by the sacrificial method. </p>
    </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="12">
    <p>
      As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service: the way of regulative principles and the way of full attachment in love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of K???a consciousness it is better to cultivate knowledge, because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. In the cultivation of knowledge there are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the <![CDATA[<i>brahma?as, k?atriyas, vaisyas</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>sudras,</i>]]> which we shall find in the last chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of <![CDATA[<i>karma</i>]]> for some good cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service in K???a consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one''s activities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may take either the step-by-step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far as <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. </p>
        </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="15">
    <p>A few of a devotee''s qualifications are further being described. No one is put into difficulty, anxiety, fearfulness or dissatisfaction by such a devotee. Since a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way as to put others into anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into anxiety, he is not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he is not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually because a devotee is always engrossed in K???a consciousness and engaged in devotional service, such material circumstances cannot move him. Generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification and he hasn''t, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected. A devotee who is always transcendental to all these disturbances is very dear to K???a.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="16">
    <p>Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it. If automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not agitated. Naturally a devotee takes a bath at least twice in a day and rises early in the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly and outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the essence of all activities of life and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A devotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree. He is never pained, because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of devotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him by advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and for that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house for his personal relations.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="12" sloka="17">
    <p>A pure devotee is neither happy nor distressed over material gain and loss, nor is he very much anxious to get a son or disciple, nor is he distressed by not getting them. If he loses anything which is very dear to him, he does not lament. Similarly, if he does not get what he desires, he is not distressed. He is transcendental in the face of all kinds of auspicious, inauspicious and sinful activities. He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is an impediment in the discharge of his devotional service. Such a devotee is very dear to K???a.</p>

      In this chapter, from verse 2 through the end—from <![CDATA[<i><it>mayy avesya mano ye mam</it></i>]]> <it>("fixing the mind on Me") through <![CDATA[<i><it>ye tu dharmam?tam idam</it></i>]]><it>("this religion of eternal engagement")—the Supreme Lord has explained the processes of transcendental service for approaching Him. Such processes are very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question of who is better—one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead—was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K???a consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically. <p></p>
          <p>
            Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the Srimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Devotional Service.

    <p>While discussing the subject of the body and the knower of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, K???a says, "I am also the knower, but I am not the individual knower of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the Paramatma, or Supersoul."</p>
    <p>
      One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> can attain to knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>The Lord says, "I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body." The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies.</p>
    <p>The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H??ikesa, Which means "the controller of the senses." He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state; the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord says, "I am also the knower." This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:</p>
    <p>
      k?etra?i hi sarira?i<br/>
      bija? capi subhasubhe<br/>
      tani vetti sa yogatma<br/>
      tata? k?etra-jña ucyate
    </p>
    <p>
      This body is called the <![CDATA[<i>k?etra,</i>]]> and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of activities, the knower of activities, and the supreme knower of activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as <![CDATA[<i>jñana.</i>]]> That is the opinion of K???a. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of <![CDATA[<i>prak?ti</i>]]> (nature), <![CDATA[<i>puru?a</i>]]> (the enjoyer of nature) and <![CDATA[<i>isvara</i>]]> (the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul). One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language (in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.12), <![CDATA[<i>bhokta bhogya? preritara? ca matva/ sarva? prokta? tri vidham-brahmam etat.</i>]]> There are three Brahman conceptions: <![CDATA[<i>prak?ti</i>]]> is Brahman as the field of activities, and the <![CDATA[<i>jiva</i>]]> (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.<p>
          <p>
            In this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly, "I am also the knower of the field of activity." One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has his individual capacity for lording it over material nature, there are different bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word <![CDATA[<i>ca</i>]]> is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion of Srila Baladeva Vidyabhu?a?a. K???a is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul. And K???a explicitly says here that real knowledge is to know that the Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer.

    <p>
      The Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of activities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this body is constituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this body is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the individual soul is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. One should also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the Supersoul, their different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to understand this <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all this will be clarified. But one should be careful not to consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body to be one with the individual soul, the <![CDATA[<i>jiva.</i>]]> This is something like equating the potent and the impotent.

    <p>
      The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K???a is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta,</i>]]> which is accepted as authority. First He says, "This is according to different sages." As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyasadeva (the author of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]>) is a great sage, and in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> duality is perfectly explained. And Vyasadeva''s father, Parasara, is also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity, <![CDATA[<i>aham tva? ca tathanye.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>..</i>]]> "we—you, I and the various other living entities—are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different <![CDATA[<i>karma.</i>]]> As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental." Similarly, in the original <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the <![CDATA[<i>Ka?ha Upani?ad.</i>]]> There are many great sages who have explained this, and Parasara is considered principal among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word <![CDATA[<i>chandobhi?</i>]]> refers to the various Vedic literatures. The <![CDATA[<i>Taittiriya Upani?ad,</i>]]> for example, which is a branch of the <![CDATA[<i>Yajur Veda,</i>]]> describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated before, <![CDATA[<i>k?etra</i>]]> is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of <![CDATA[<i>k?etra-jña:</i>]]> the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Taittiriya Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.5), <![CDATA[<i>brahma puccha? prati??ha.</i>]]> There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord''s energy known as <![CDATA[<i>anna-maya,</i>]]> dependence upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then, in <![CDATA[<i>pra?a-maya,</i>]]> after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms. In <![CDATA[<i>jñana-maya,</i>]]> realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking, feeling and willing. Then there is Brahman realization, called <![CDATA[<i>vijñana-maya,</i>]]> in which the living entity''s mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is <![CDATA[<i>ananda-maya,</i>]]> realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which are called <![CDATA[<i>brahma puccham.</i>]]> Out of these, the first three—<![CDATA[<i>anna-maya, pra?a-maya</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>jñana-maya</i>]]>—involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called <![CDATA[<i>ananda-maya.</i>]]> The <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> also describes the Supreme by saying, <![CDATA[<i>ananda-mayo ''bhyasat:</i>]]> the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into <![CDATA[<i>vijñana-maya, pra?a-maya, jñana-maya</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>anna-maya.</i>]]> In the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the <![CDATA[<i>ananda-maya.</i>]]> That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the <![CDATA[<i>ananda-maya,</i>]]> then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme knower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities. One has to search for this truth in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra,</i>]]> or <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sutra.</i>]]><p>
        <p>
          It is mentioned here that the codes of the <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sutra</i>]]> are very nicely arranged according to cause and effect. Some of the <![CDATA[<i>sutras,</i>]]> or aphorisms, are <![CDATA[<i><bd->na viyad asrute?</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.3.2), <![CDATA[<i><bd->natma srute?</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.3.18), and <![CDATA[<i><bd->parat tu tac-chrute?</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.3.40). The first aphorism indicates the field of activities, the second indicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the <![CDATA[<i>summum bonum</i>]]> among all the manifestations of various entities. <p></p>
              </bd>
            </bd>
          </bd>
        </p>

        </bd>
    </p>
    </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="13" sloka="13">
    <p>
      The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field. He has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities. Now He begins to explain the knowable, first the soul and then the Supersoul. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the <![CDATA[<i>jiva</i>]]> was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of the <![CDATA[<i>jivatma''s</i>]]> manifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature confirms this: <![CDATA[<i>na jayate mriyate va vipascit</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Ka?ha Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.2.18). The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge.<p></p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is also stated in the Vedic literature (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>6.16) to be <![CDATA[<i>pradhana-k?etrajña-patir gu?esa?,</i>]]> the chief knower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature. In the <![CDATA[<i>sm?ti</i>]]> it is said, <![CDATA[<i>dasa-bhuto harer eva nanyasyaiva kadacana.</i>]]> The living entities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teachings. Therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood that he is <![CDATA[<i>vijñana-brahma</i>]]> as opposed to <![CDATA[<i>ananda-brahma.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>Ananda-brahma</i>]]> is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead. <p></p>

  <slokas chapter="13" sloka="14">
    <p>
      As the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or Supreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great teacher, Brahma, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul, however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not possible. If he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In <![CDATA[<i><it>Bhagavad-gita</it></i>]]> <it>the Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He accepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That is His potency. In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Brahma-sa?hita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(5.37) it is stated, <![CDATA[<i>goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhuta?:</i>]]> although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is all-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading. Therefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not the individual soul. <p></p>

  <slokas chapter="13" sloka="15">
    <p>
      The Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities, doesn''t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual souls have spiritual senses, but in conditioned life they are covered with the material elements, and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The Supreme Lord''s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are therefore called <![CDATA[<i>nirgu?a.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>Gu?a</i>]]> means the material modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensory activities, He has His transcendental senses, which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(3.19) in the verse <![CDATA[<i>apa?i-pado javano grahita.</i>]]> The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes—otherwise how could He see? He sees everything—past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed in <![CDATA[<i><it>Bhagavad-gita<it>:</it></it></i>]]><it>
          <it>
            He knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.<p>
              <p>
                <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy, because He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form, called <![CDATA[<i>sac-cid-ananda-vigraha</i>]]><it><![CDATA[<i><it->[Bs.<it> </it></it-></i>]]>5.1<it->]<![CDATA[<i><it>.</it></i>]]> He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can see the Lord''s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists, who are still materially affected, cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.<p></p>

    <p>
      In Vedic literature we understand that Naraya?a, the Supreme Person, is residing both outside and inside of every living entity. He is present in both the spiritual and material worlds. Although He is far, far away, still He is near to us. These are the statements of Vedic literature. <![CDATA[<i>Asino dura? vrajati sayano yati sarvata?</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Ka?ha Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]>1.2.21). 
     </p>
    <p>
      And because He is always engaged in transcendental bliss, we cannot understand how He is enjoying His full opulence. We cannot see or understand with these material senses. Therefore in the Vedic language it is said that to understand Him our material mind and senses cannot act. But one who has purified his mind and senses by practicing K???a consciousness in devotional service can see Him constantly. It is confirmed in <![CDATA[<i><it>Brahma-sa?hita</it></i>]]> <it>that the devotee who has developed love for the Supreme God can see Him always, without cessation. And it is confirmed in <![CDATA[<i>bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(11.54) that He can be seen and understood only by devotional service. <![CDATA[<i>Bhaktya tv ananyaya sakya?.</i>]]> <p></p>

      The Lord is situated in everyone''s heart as the Supersoul. Does this mean that He has become divided? No. Actually, He is one. The example is given of the sun: The sun, at the meridian, is situated in its place. But if one goes for five thousand miles in all directions and asks, "Where is the sun?" everyone will say that it is shining on his head. In the Vedic literature this example is given to show that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also it is said in Vedic literature that one Vi??u is present everywhere by His omnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the Supreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours everything at the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the Lord said that He had come to devour all the warriors assembled at Kuruk?etra. He also mentioned that in the form of time He devours also. He is the annihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He develops all from their original state, and at the time of annihilation He devours them. The Vedic hymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest of all. After creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after annihilation everything again returns to rest in Him. These are the confirmations of Vedic hymns. <![CDATA[<i>Yato va imani bhutani jayante yena jatani jivanti yat prayanty abhisa?-visanti tad brahma tad vijijñasasva</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Taittiriya Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]>3.1).<p></p>

    <p>
      The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light in all luminous objects like the sun, moon and stars. In the Vedic literature we find that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon, because the effulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material world that <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir,</i>]]> the Lord''s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the <![CDATA[<i>mahat-tattva,</i>]]> the material elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world, which is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature. <![CDATA[<i>Aditya—var?a? tamasa? parastat</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>3.8). He is just like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world.<p>
          <p>
            His knowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord, who is situated in everyone''s heart. One Vedic <![CDATA[<i>mantra</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>6.18) says, <![CDATA[<i>ta? ha devam atma-buddhi-prakasa? mumuk?ur vai sara?am aha? prapadye.</i>]]> One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned, it is also confirmed in Vedic literature: <![CDATA[<i>tam eva viditvati m?tyum eti.</i>]]> "Only by knowing Him can one surpass the boundary of birth and death." (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>3.8)<p>
                  <p>
                    He is situated in everyone''s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity—the individual soul and the Supersoul—must be admitted. One''s hands and legs are distributed locally, but K???a''s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is confirmed in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Svetasvatara Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(3.17): <![CDATA[<i>sarvasya prabhum isana? sarvasya sara?a? b?hat.</i>]]> That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the <![CDATA[<i>prabhu,</i>]]> or master, of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the individual soul are always different. <p></p>

      The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable. This knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of knowing. Combined, these are called <![CDATA[<i>vijñana,</i>]]> or the science of knowledge. Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this. Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in K???a consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we transfer all consciousness to K???a''s activities and realize that K???a is everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained.

    <p>
      Now, to summarize, one may understand that verses 6 and 7, beginning from <![CDATA[<i>maha-bhutani</i>]]> and continuing through <![CDATA[<i>cetana dh?ti?,</i>]]> analyze the material elements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life. These combine to form the body, or the field of activities. And verses 8 through 12, from <![CDATA[<i>amanitvam</i>]]> through <![CDATA[<i>tattva-jñanartha-darsanam,</i>]]> describe the process of knowledge for understanding both types of knower of the field of activities, namely the soul and the Supersoul. Then verses 13 through 18, beginning from <![CDATA[<i>anadi mat-param</i>]]> and continuing through <![CDATA[<i>h?di sarvasya vi??hitam,</i>]]> describe the soul and the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul.<p>

          Thus three items have been described: the field of activity (the body), the process of understanding, and both the soul and the Supersoul. It is especially described here that only the unalloyed devotees of the Lord can understand these three items clearly. So for these devotees <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is fully useful; it is they who can attain the supreme goal, the nature of the Supreme Lord, K???a. In other words, only devotees, and not others, can understand <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and derive the desired result.

    <p>
      By the knowledge given in this chapter, one can understand the body (the field of activities) and the knowers of the body (both the individual soul and the Supersoul). The body is the field of activity and is composed of material nature. The individual soul that is embodied and enjoying the activities of the body is the <![CDATA[<i>puru?a,</i>]]> or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of the Supreme Lord, and so also are the living entities, but the living entities are of the superior energy. Both the living entities and material nature existed before this cosmos was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Maha-vi??u, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of <![CDATA[<i>mahat-tattva.</i>]]> Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are averse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. But with the coming forth of material nature these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is concerned, living entities are all the same.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="13" sloka="21">
    <p>
      The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these varieties are creations of the material nature. They arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this body or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body, and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire different kinds of pleasures for the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total—body and instrument senses—are offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one''s desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the living entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Mu??aka Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]>3.1.1) as follows: <![CDATA[<i>dva supar?a sayuja sakhaya?.</i>]]> The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul, or Paramatma. </p>
    </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="13" sloka="22">
    <p>
      This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.<p>
        <p>
          How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position. That is called K???a consciousness. Unless one is situated in K???a consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science of God from K???a. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic <![CDATA[<i>mantra</i>]]> it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.

      It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity. Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is represented as the Paramatma in every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is <![CDATA[<i>para,</i>]]> transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field, but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer. His name is Paramatma, not <![CDATA[<i>atma,</i>]]> and He is transcendental. It is distinctly clear that the <![CDATA[<i>atma</i>]]> and Paramatma are different. The Supersoul, the Paramatma, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because the Paramatma is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul''s desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is <![CDATA[<i>bhukta,</i>]]> or the sustained, and the Lord is <![CDATA[<i>bhokta,</i>]]> or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that every individual living entity is eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and act independently in an attempt to dominate nature, and because he has this tendency he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living entity can be situated either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute independence the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives instructions as stated in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> and from within He tries to convince the living entity that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness. "Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be happy," He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the Paramatma or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a blissful eternal life of knowledge.

    <p>
      Clear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual soul and their interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and turn to the spiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this material nature. This is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand distinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material existence. By his personal endeavor in association with authorities, saintly persons and a spiritual master, he has to understand his position and then revert to spiritual consciousness or K???a consciousness by understanding <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> as it is explained by the Personality of Godhead. Then it is certain that he will never come again into this material existence; he will be transferred into the spiritual world for a blissful eternal life of knowledge.

      The Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned souls can be divided into two classes as far as man''s search for self-realization is concerned. Those who are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding. But there are others, who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life, and they are called introspective devotees, philosophers, and workers who have renounced fruitive results. Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are best situated in spiritual understanding, because they understand that beyond this material nature are the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is expanded as the Paramatma, the Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be counted in the class of the faithful. The Sa?khya philosophers analyze this material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as the twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service in K???a consciousness. Those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in K???a consciousness. Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul within themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge, and there are others who cultivate the <![CDATA[<i>ha?ha-yoga</i>]]> system and who try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities.

    <p>This verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern society there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached K???a consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, one will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly, the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home. </p>

    <p>Both material nature and the living entity, which were existing before the creation of the cosmos, are explained in this verse. Whatever is created is but a combination of the living entity and material nature. There are many manifestations like trees, mountains and hills which are not moving, and there are many existences which are moving, and all of them are but combinations of material nature and the superior nature, the living entity. Without the touch of the superior nature, the living entity, nothing can grow. The relationship between material nature and spiritual nature is eternally going on, and this combination is effected by the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the controller of both the superior and inferior natures. The material nature is created by Him, and the superior nature is placed in this material nature, and thus all these activities and manifestations take place. </p>

      Anyone who by good association can see three things combined together—the body, the proprietor of the body, or individual soul, and the friend of the individual soul—is actually in knowledge. Unless one has the association of a real knower of spiritual subjects, one cannot see these three things. Those who do not have such association are ignorant; they simply see the body, and they think that when the body is destroyed everything is finished. But actually it is not so. After the destruction of the body, both the soul and the Supersoul exist, and they go on eternally in many various moving and nonmoving forms. The Sanskrit word <![CDATA[<i>paramesvara</i>]]> is sometimes translated as "the individual soul" because the soul is the master of the body and after the destruction of the body he transfers to another form. In that way he is master. But there are others who interpret this <![CDATA[<i><it>paramesvara</it></i>]]><it> to be the Supersoul. In either case, both the Supersoul and the individual soul continue. They are not destroyed. One who can see in this way can actually see what is happening.<p></p>

    <p>The living entity, by accepting his material existence, has become situated differently than in his spiritual existence. But if one understands that the Supreme is situated in His Paramatma manifestation everywhere, that is, if one can see the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living thing, he does not degrade himself by a destructive mentality, and he therefore gradually advances to the spiritual world. The mind is generally addicted to sense gratifying processes; but when the mind turns to the Supersoul, one becomes advanced in spiritual understanding. </p>

    <p>This body is made by material nature under the direction of the Supersoul, and whatever activities are going on in respect to one''s body are not his doing. Whatever one is supposed to do, either for happiness or for distress, one is forced to do because of the bodily constitution. The self, however, is outside all these bodily activities. This body is given according to one''s past desires. To fulfill desires, one is given the body, with which he acts accordingly. Practically speaking, the body is a machine, designed by the Supreme Lord, to fulfill desires. Because of desires, one is put into difficult circumstances to suffer or to enjoy. This transcendental vision of the living entity, when developed, makes one separate from bodily activities. One who has such a vision is an actual seer. </p>

    <p>When one can see that the various bodies of living entities arise due to the different desires of the individual soul and do not actually belong to the soul itself, one actually sees. In the material conception of life, we find someone a demigod, someone a human being, a dog, a cat, etc. This is material vision, not actual vision. This material differentiation is due to a material conception of life. After the destruction of the material body, the spirit soul is one. The spirit soul, due to contact with material nature, gets different types of bodies. When one can see this, he attains spiritual vision; thus being freed from differentiations like man, animal, big, low, etc., one becomes purified in his consciousness and able to develop K???a consciousness in his spiritual identity. How he then sees things will be explained in the next verse. </p>

He does not engage himself in any material activities; therefore the activities performed due to his contact with material bodies do not entangle him. </p>

No one in science can ascertain this. </p>

      There are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> the example of the sun and the sunshine is given. As the sun is situated in one place but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit soul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole body by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun. When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body, and as soon as the soul has passed from the body there is no more consciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore consciousness is not a product of the combinations of matter. It is the symptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme, because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual soul, is conscious of all bodies. That is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual consciousness.

      From the Seventh Chapter to the end of the Twelfth Chapter, Sri K???a in detail reveals the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, the Lord Himself is further enlightening Arjuna. If one understands this chapter through the process of philosophical speculation, he will come to an understanding of devotional service. In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material entanglement. It has also been explained that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world. Now, in this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature are, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge, various great sages attained perfection and transferred to the spiritual world. The Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This knowledge is far, far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing this many attained perfection. Thus it is expected that one who understands this Fourteenth Chapter will attain perfection. <p></p>

    <p>After acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative equality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the repetition of birth and death. One does not, however, lose his identity as an individual soul. It is understood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls who have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental loving service. So, even after liberation, the devotees do not lose their individual identities.</p>
    <p>Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by the three modes of material nature. Knowledge which is not contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge. As soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as the Supreme Person. Those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the material activities of the material form, this spiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness. However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world, in the spiritual world there is also variegatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky, one attains a spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual situation is called devotional life. That atmosphere is said to be uncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To obtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities. One who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or by the destruction of the material world. </p>

      This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the combination of <![CDATA[<i>k?etra</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>k?etra-jña,</i>]]> the body and the spirit soul. This combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the Supreme God Himself. The <![CDATA[<i>mahat-tattva</i>]]> is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation; and that total substance of the material cause, in which there are three modes of nature, is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes become possible. This total material substance, the <![CDATA[<i>mahat-tattva,</i>]]> is described as Brahman in the Vedic literature (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Mu??aka Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.1.9): <![CDATA[<i>tasmad etad brahma nama-rupam anna? ca jayate.</i>]]> The Supreme Person impregnates that Brahman with the seeds of the living entities. The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, fire and air, are all material energy, and they constitute what is called <![CDATA[<i>mahad brahma,</i>]]> or the great Brahman, the material nature. As explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is another, superior nature—the living entity. Into material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature.<p>
        <p>The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion. Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, so that the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world.</p>

Such living entities are seen not only on this planet but on every planet, even on the highest, where Brahma is situated. Everywhere there are living entities; within the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and K???a''s seed-giving process. The purport is that the material world is impregnated with living entities, who come out in various forms at the time of creation according to their past deeds. </p>

    <p>The living entity, because he is transcendental, has nothing to do with this material nature. Still, because he has become conditioned by the material world, he is acting under the spell of the three modes of material nature. Because living entities have different kinds of bodies, in terms of the different aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature. This is the cause of the varieties of happiness and distress. </p>
  </slokas>
<slokas chapter="14" sloka="6">
    <p>
      The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities'' conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a,</i>]]> who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly one may become a philosopher, a scientist or a poet, and repeatedly become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant. </p>

  <slokas chapter="14" sloka="7">
    <p>The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman. Woman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman. This is called the mode of passion. And when the mode of passion is increased, one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standard of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness, what to speak of those who are entangled in the mode of passion? </p>

      In this verse the specific application of the word <![CDATA[<i>tu</i>]]> is very significant. This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature. <![CDATA[<i>Vastu-yathatmya-jñanavaraka? viparyaya-jñana-janaka? tama?:</i>]]> under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand a thing as it is. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance.

    <p>A person in the mode of goodness is satisfied by his work or intellectual pursuit, just as a philosopher, scientist or educator may be engaged in a particular field of knowledge and may be satisfied in that way. A man in the mode of passion may be engaged in fruitive activity; he owns as much as he can and spends for good causes. Sometimes he tries to open hospitals, give to charity institutions, etc. These are signs of one in the mode of passion. And the mode of ignorance covers knowledge. In the mode of ignorance, whatever one does is good neither for him nor for anyone. </p>

      When the mode of passion is prominent, the modes of goodness and ignorance are defeated. When the mode of goodness is prominent, passion and ignorance are defeated. And when the mode of ignorance is prominent, passion and goodness are defeated. This competition is always going on. Therefore, one who is actually intent on advancing in K???a consciousness has to transcend these three modes. The prominence of some certain mode of nature is manifested in one''s dealings, in his activities, in eating, etc. All this will be explained in later chapters. But if one wants, he can develop, by practice, the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and passion. One can similarly develop the mode of passion and defeat goodness and ignorance. Or one can develop the mode of ignorance and defeat goodness and passion. Although there are these three modes of material nature, if one is determined he can be blessed by the mode of goodness, and by transcending the mode of goodness he can be situated in pure goodness, which is called the <![CDATA[<i>Vasudeva</i>]]> state, a state in which one can understand the science of God. By the manifestation of particular activities, it can be understood in what mode of nature one is situated.

    <p>There are nine gates in the body: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the genitals and the anus. When every gate is illuminated by the symptoms of goodness, it should be understood that one has developed the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, one can see things in the right position, one can hear things in the right position, and one can taste things in the right position. One becomes cleansed inside and outside. In every gate there is development of the symptoms of happiness, and that is the position of goodness.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="14" sloka="12">
    <p>One in the mode of passion is never satisfied with the position he has already acquired; he hankers to increase his position. If he wants to construct a residential house, he tries his best to have a palatial house, as if he would be able to reside in that house eternally. And he develops a great hankering for sense gratification. There is no end to sense gratification. He always wants to remain with his family and in his house and to continue the process of sense gratification. There is no cessation of this. All these symptoms should be understood as characteristic of the mode of passion.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="14" sloka="13">
    <p>When there is no illumination, knowledge is absent. One in the mode of ignorance does not work by a regulative principle; he wants to act whimsically, for no purpose. Even though he has the capacity to work, he makes no endeavor. This is called illusion. Although consciousness is going on, life is inactive. These are the symptoms of one in the mode of ignorance. </p>

      One in goodness attains higher planetary systems, like Brahmaloka or Janaloka, and there enjoys godly happiness. The word <![CDATA[<i>amalan</i>]]> is significant; it means "free from the modes of passion and ignorance." There are impurities in the material world, but the mode of goodness is the purest form of existence in the material world. There are different kinds of planets for different kinds of living entities. Those who die in the mode of goodness are elevated to the planets where great sages and great devotees live.

    <p>Some people have the impression that when the soul reaches the platform of human life it never goes down again. This is incorrect. According to this verse, if one develops the mode of ignorance, after his death he is degraded to an animal form of life. From there one has to again elevate himself, by an evolutionary process, to come again to the human form of life. Therefore, those who are actually serious about human life should take to the mode of goodness and in good association transcend the modes and become situated in K???a consciousness. This is the aim of human life. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the human being will again attain to the human status. </p>
  </slokas>
<slokas chapter="14" sloka="16">
    <p>
      The result of pious activities in the mode of goodness is pure. Therefore the sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. But activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil. The miseries are there. Thus <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There may be a little so-called mental happiness—"I have this house or this money"—but this is not actual happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, <![CDATA[<i>maya,</i>]]> the animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is a son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant''s being killed. One has to pay for it. So indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals, because God has supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature (<![CDATA[<i><bd->?g Veda</bd-></i>]]><bd>9.46.4) the words <![CDATA[<i>gobhi? pri?ita-matsaram</i>]]> indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states:<p>
          <p>
            namo brahma?ya-devaya<br/>
            go-brahma?a-hitaya ca<br/>
            jagad-dhitaya k???aya<br/>
            govindaya namo nama?
          </p>
          <p>
            "My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the <![CDATA[<i>brahma?as,</i>]]> and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world." (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Vi??u Pura?a</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.19.65) The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the <![CDATA[<i>brahma?as.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>Brahma?as</i>]]> are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the <![CDATA[<i>brahma?as</i>]]> and the cows, must be given all protection—that is real advancement of civilization. In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, K???a consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger. <p></p>

    <p>Since the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities, K???a consciousness is recommended. Through K???a consciousness, society will develop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is developed, people will see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people are just like animals and cannot see things clearly. In the mode of ignorance, for example, they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking the chance of being killed by the same animal in the next life. Because people have no education in actual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To stop this irresponsibility, education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there. When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become sober, in full knowledge of things as they are. Then people will be happy and prosperous. Even if the majority of the people aren''t happy and prosperous, if a certain percentage of the population develops K???a consciousness and becomes situated in the mode of goodness, then there is the possibility for peace and prosperity all over the world. Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity. In the mode of passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangements for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind. That is not possible, because one is situated in the mode of passion. If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing K???a consciousness. When one is engaged in the mode of passion, not only is he mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very troublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of ignorance, people become mad. Being distressed by their circumstances, they take shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance. Their future in life is very dark. </p>

  <slokas chapter="14" sloka="18">
    <p>In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more explicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree of development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahma, resides. We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring us to this.</p>
    <p>The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth, in the mode of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming mad in the next life.</p>
    <p>
      The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable. The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in material nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million species of life—birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc.—and according to the development of the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions. The word <![CDATA[<i>tamasa?</i>]]> is very significant here. <![CDATA[<i>Tamasa?</i>]]> indicates those who stay continuously in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode. Their future is very dark.
    </p>
    <p>There is an opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be elevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called K???a consciousness. But one who does not take advantage of this opportunity will certainly continue in the lower modes. </p>

  <slokas chapter="14" sloka="19">
    <p>
      One can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. The real spiritual master is K???a, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to Arjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in K???a consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature. Otherwise, one''s life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the material modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated. With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and by such an understanding he can become fixed in full K???a consciousness. A man in K???a consciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to K???a is relieved from the activities of material nature. For one who is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases. <p></p>

      How one can stay in the transcendental position, even in this body, in full K??a consciousness, is explained in this verse. The Sanskrit word <![CDATA[<i>dehi</i>]]> means "embodied." Although one is within this material body, by his advancement in spiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature. He can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because, after leaving this body, he is certainly going to the spiritual sky. But even in this body he can enjoy spiritual happiness. In other words, devotional service in K???a consciousness is the sign of liberation from material entanglement, and this will be explained in the Eighteenth Chapter. When one is freed from the influence of the modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service.

    <p>In this verse, Arjuna''s questions are very appropriate. He wants to know the symptoms of a person who has already transcended the material modes. He first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How can one understand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature? The second question asks how he lives and what his activities are. Are they regulated or nonregulated? Then Arjuna inquires of the means by which he can attain the transcendental nature. That is very important. Unless one knows the direct means by which one can be situated always transcendentally, there is no possibility of showing the symptoms. So all these questions put by Arjuna are very important, and the Lord answers them. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="14" sloka="26">
    <p>
      This verse is a reply to Arjuna''s third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K???a activities. K???a activities are known as <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]>—always acting for K???a. This includes not only K???a, but His different plenary expansions such as Rama and Naraya?a. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of K???a, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K???a are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of K???a or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, one can overcome them easily. This has already been explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K???a at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in K???a consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire equality with K???a. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity, in his spiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as K???a in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>Bhakti-yoga</i>]]> means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be no meaning to <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga.</i>]]> If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature, <![CDATA[<i>brahmaiva san brahmapy eti.</i>]]> One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as an individual soul. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="14" sloka="27">
    <p>
      The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Paramatma, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramatma and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Paramatma realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kumaras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down. In <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going further, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said, <![CDATA[<i>raso vai sa?, rasa? hy evaya? labdhvanandi bhavati:</i>]]> "When one understands the Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of pleasure, K???a, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful." (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Taittiriya Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, and eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.<p>
        <p>
          The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full K???a consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering—the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service—should be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one''s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord''s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir</i>]]> or the different varieties of the Brahman conception is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.
          <p>
            Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the Srimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.

    <p>
      After the discussion of the importance of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga,</i>]]> one may question, "What about the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]>?" It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic study is to understand K???a. Therefore one who is in K???a consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas.</i>]]>
    </p>
    <p>The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree. This tree''s roots grow upward because they begin from where Brahma is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.</p>
    <p>
      This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities'' activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation.<p>
        <p>Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as a tree''s reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things'' being situated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then he can cut off his relationship with it.</p>
        <p>
          This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica. Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahman to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to Sa?khya philosophy, come <![CDATA[<i>prak?ti, puru?a,</i>]]> then the three <![CDATA[<i>gu?as,</i>]]> then the five gross elements (<![CDATA[<i>pañca-maha-bhuta</i>]]>), then the ten senses (<![CDATA[<i>dasendriya</i>]]>), mind, etc. In this way they divide up the whole material world into twenty-four elements. If Brahman is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The <![CDATA[<i>prak?ti</i>]]> is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the <![CDATA[<i>puru?a</i>]]> is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The material reflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person knows the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas.</i>]]> One who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas.</i>]]> The purpose of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world. <p></p>

  <slokas chapter="15" sloka="2">
    <p>The description of the banyan tree is further explained here. Its branches spread in all directions. In the lower parts, there are variegated manifestations of living entities—human beings, animals, horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas and many other higher species of life. As a tree is nourished by water, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature. Sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water, and sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where particular modes of material nature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life are manifested accordingly.</p>
    <p>
      The twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By development of the different modes of nature we develop different senses, and by the senses we enjoy different varieties of sense objects. The tips of the branches are the senses—the ears, nose, eyes, etc.—which are attached to the enjoyment of different sense objects. The twigs are sound, form, touch, and so on—the sense objects. The subsidiary roots are attachments and aversions, which are byproducts of different varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to develop from these secondary roots, which spread in all directions. The real root is from Brahmaloka, and the other roots are in the human planetary systems. After one enjoys the results of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems, he comes down to this earth and renews his <![CDATA[<i>karma,</i>]]> or fruitive activities for promotion. This planet of human beings is considered the field of activities.

  <slokas chapter="15" sloka="5">
    <p>The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social and national affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And when one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. </p>

      The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a—which is known as K???aloka, Goloka V?ndavana is described here. In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity, because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called Vaiku??has) constitutes the shining sky known as the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-jyotir.</i>]]> Actually, the effulgence is emanating from the planet of K???a, Goloka V?ndavana. Part of that shining effulgence is covered by the <![CDATA[<i>mahat-tattva,</i>]]> the material world. Other than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called Vaiku??has, chief of which is Goloka V?ndavana.

    <p>As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.</p>
    <p>
      One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to K???a consciousness there is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with devotees, those who are in K???a consciousness. One should search out a society dedicated to K???a consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental.<p>
        <p>
          The words <![CDATA[<i>parama? mama</i>]]> are very important here. Actually every nook and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is <![CDATA[<i>paramam,</i>]]> full of six opulences. The <![CDATA[<i><bd->Ka?ha Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.2.15) also confirms that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine, moonshine or stars (<![CDATA[<i>na tatra suryo bhati na candratarakam</i>]]>), for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no other means. <p></p>

      In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord—eternally. It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said, <![CDATA[<i>sanatana?.</i>]]> According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called <![CDATA[<i>vi??u-tattva</i>]]> and the secondary expansions are called the living entities. In other words, the <![CDATA[<i>vi??u-tattva</i>]]> is the personal expansion, and the living entities are the separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord Rama, N?si?ha-deva, Vi??umurti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaiku??ha planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, he is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The living entities, not only human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world—Brahma, Lord Siva and even Vi??u—are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The word <![CDATA[<i>kar?ati</i>]]> ("struggling" or "grappling hard") is very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity. The following information is there in the <![CDATA[<i>Madhyandinayana-sruti:</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>sa va e?a brahma-ni??ha ida? sarira? martyam atis?jya brahmabhisampadya brahma?a pasyati brahma?a s??oti brahma?aiveda? sarvam anubhavati.</i>]]> It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. From <![CDATA[<i>sm?ti</i>]]> also it is understood, <![CDATA[<i>vasanti yatra puru?a? sarve vaiku??ha-murtaya?:</i>]]> in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead''s. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part-and-parcel living entities and the expansions of <![CDATA[<i>vi??u-murti.</i>]]> In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words <![CDATA[<i>mamaiva?sa?</i>]]> ("fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord") are also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not like matter, which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here, because the Sanskrit word <![CDATA[<i>sanatana</i>]]> ("eternal") is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that in each and every individual body the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present (<![CDATA[<i><it>dehino ''smin yatha dehe</it></i>]]><it>). That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one with the Lord, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold. <p></p>

      Here the living entity is described as <![CDATA[<i>isvara,</i>]]> the controller of his own body. If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body undergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat''s or dog''s body. And if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities, he will change into the form of a demigod. And if he is in K???a consciousness, he will be transferred to K???aloka in the spiritual world and will associate with K???a. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to <![CDATA[<i>karma,</i>]]> and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called <![CDATA[<i>kar?ati,</i>]]> or struggle for existence.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="15" sloka="9">
    <p>In other words, if the living entity adulterates his consciousness with the qualities of cats and dogs, in his next life he gets a cat or dog body and enjoys. Consciousness is originally pure, like water. But if we mix water with a certain color, it changes. Similarly, consciousness is pure, for the spirit soul is pure. But consciousness is changed according to the association of the material qualities. Real consciousness is K???a consciousness. When, therefore, one is situated in K???a consciousness, he is in his pure life. But if his consciousness is adulterated by some type of material mentality, in the next life he gets a corresponding body. He does not necessarily get a human body again; he can get the body of a cat, dog, hog, demigod or one of many other forms, for there are 8,400,000 species. </p>

      The word <![CDATA[<i>jñana-cak?u?a?</i>]]> is very significant. Without knowledge, one cannot understand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form of body he is going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living in a particular type of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances, he is living under certain circumstances, and he is enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power to understand their change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it. Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly developed in K???a consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome. They should come out of it and be K???a conscious and liberate themselves to transfer to the spiritual world.

      There are many transcendentalists on the path of spiritual self-realization, but one who is not situated in self-realization cannot see how things are changing in the body of the living entity. The word <![CDATA[<i>yogina?</i>]]> is significant in this connection. In the present day there are many so-called <![CDATA[<i>yogis,</i>]]> and there are many so-called associations of <![CDATA[<i>yogis,</i>]]> but they are actually blind in the matter of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise and are satisfied if the body is well built and healthy. They have no other information. They are called <![CDATA[<i>yatanto ''py ak?tatmana?.</i>]]> Even though they are endeavoring in a so-called <![CDATA[<i>yoga</i>]]> system, they are not self-realized. Such people cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only those who are actually in the <![CDATA[<i>yoga</i>]]> system and have realized the self, the world, and the Supreme Lord—in other words, the <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yogis,</i>]]> those engaged in pure devotional service in K???a consciousness—can understand how things are taking place.

  <slokas chapter="15" sloka="12">
    <p>The unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. But one can begin to be established in knowledge by understanding what the Lord explains here. Everyone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of K???a consciousness, lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material world. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back to home.</p>
    <p>
      From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also, but in each universe there is only one sun. As stated in <![CDATA[<i><bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(10.21), the moon is one of the stars (<![CDATA[<i>nak?atra?am aha? sasi</i>]]>). Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their foodstuff, they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, then one''s K???a consciousness will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. Without His mercy there cannot be sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are some thoughts to provoke K???a consciousness in the conditioned soul.<p></p>

      It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living being. That is discussed in the <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sa?hita.</i>]]> It is said there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramatma, enters into the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, the body sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust''s falling, but if one throws it in the air it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which are floating in the air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and nonmoving things stay in their place. It is said in the Vedic hymns that because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables. Due to the moon''s influence, the vegetables become delicious. Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent. Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word <![CDATA[<i>rasatmaka?</i>]]> is very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme Lord through the influence of the moon.

      According to Ayur-vedic <![CDATA[<i>sastra,</i>]]> we understand that there is a fire in the stomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not blazing there is no hunger, and when the fire is in order we become hungry. Sometimes when the fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras (<![CDATA[<i><bd->B?had-ara?yaka Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>5.9.1) also confirm that the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff (<![CDATA[<i>ayam agnir vaisvanaro yo ''yam anta? puru?e yenedam anna? pacyate</i>]]>). Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independent in the eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no possibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and by His grace we are enjoying life. In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Vedanta-sutra</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.2.27) this is also confirmed. <![CDATA[<i>Sabdadibhyo ''nta? prati??hanac ca:</i>]]> the Lord is situated within sound and within the body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force. There are four kinds of foodstuff—some are drunk, some are chewed, some are licked up, and some are sucked—and He is the digestive force for all of them. <p></p>

      The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramatma in everyone''s heart, and it is from Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the different fruitive results. He is worshipable not only as the impersonal Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Paramatma, but as the form of the incarnation of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> as well. The <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> give the right direction to people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back to home. The <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, and K???a in His incarnation as Vyasadeva is the compiler of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra.</i>]]> The commentation on the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> by Vyasadeva in the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> gives the real understanding of <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra.</i>]]> The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, and the giver of knowledge in the form of <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a, the teacher of the <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <![CDATA[<i>Anta?-pravi??a? sasta jananam.</i>]]> The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord. Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> from Him. If one is serious about understanding the Vedic knowledge, then K???a gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand K???a. Vedic literature confirms this: <![CDATA[<i>yo ''sau sarvair vedair giyate.</i>]]> In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four <![CDATA[<i>Vedas, Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> and the <![CDATA[<i>Upani?ads</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>Pura?as,</i>]]> the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performance of Vedic rituals, discussion of the Vedic philosophy and worship of the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> is to understand K???a. The <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> give us direction by which to understand K???a and the process of realizing Him. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <![CDATA[<i>
        <bd->Vedanta-sutra</bd-></i>]]><bd>(1.1.4) confirms this in the following words: <![CDATA[<i>tat tu samanvayat.</i>]]> One can attain perfection in three stages. By understanding Vedic literature one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by performing the different processes one can approach Him, and at the end one can attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the purpose of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> the understanding of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas,</i>]]> and the goal of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> are clearly defined. <p></p>

      As already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vyasadeva compiled the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra.</i>]]> Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra.</i>]]> He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be divided into two classes—the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When they are in contact with the material world they are called <![CDATA[<i>jiva-bhuta,</i>]]> and the Sanskrit words given here, <![CDATA[<i>k?ara? sarva?i bhutani,</i>]]> mean that they are fallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra,</i>]]> is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K???a, there are two classes of living entities. The <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> give evidence of this, so there is no doubt about it. The living entities who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses have their material bodies, which are changing. As long as a living entity is conditioned, his body changes due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes—birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all exists in oneness. <![CDATA[<i>K?ara? sarva?i bhutani:</i>]]> any living entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created being, Brahma, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.

It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities, some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the Supreme Personality, who is Paramatma. The Upani?adic verse runs as follows: <![CDATA[<i>nityo nityana? cetanas cetananam.</i>]]> The purport is that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone''s heart as Paramatma. A wise man who can understand Him is eligible to attain perfect peace, not others. <p></p>

      No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a—neither the conditioned soul nor the liberated soul. He is therefore the greatest of personalities. Now it is clear here that the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are individuals. The difference is that the living entities, either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state, cannot surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of superiority and inferiority between their personalities. The word <![CDATA[<i>uttama</i>]]> is very significant.

That Supreme is called the Supreme Personality." This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Paramatma. By incarnating Himself as the son of Satyavati and Parasara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as Vyasadeva. <p></p>

      There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K???a to be the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K???a consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vedic knowledge is called <![CDATA[<i>sruti,</i>]]> learning by aural reception. One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like K???a and His representatives. Here K???a distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a, knows the purpose of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas;</i>]]> no one else knows the purpose of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas.</i>]]>

    <p>
      The word <![CDATA[<i>bhajati</i>]]> is very significant. In many places the word <![CDATA[<i>bhajati</i>]]> is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full K???a consciousness, in the devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vai??ava parampara it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of K???a, then there is no need for any other spiritual process for understanding the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the point, because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding. But if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.

    <p>The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are spiritual; devotional service takes place within the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance.</p>
    <p>Everyone must take to this consciousness of K???a and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of understanding K???a and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.</p>
    <p>
      The word <![CDATA[<i>anagha,</i>]]> by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. <![CDATA[<i>Anagha,</i>]]> "O sinless one," means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very difficult to understand K???a. One has to become free from all contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness.<p>
        <p>
          While one is performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full K???a consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart. In this chapter the first five verses describe the process of freeing oneself from these weaknesses of heart, and the rest of the chapter, from the sixth verse through the end, discusses <![CDATA[<i>puru?ottama-yoga.</i>]]> <p>

    <p>In this verse, the royal road to hell is described. The demoniac want to make a show of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although they do not follow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type of education or so much wealth. They desire to be worshiped by others, and demand respectability, although they do not command respect. Over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do not know what should be done and what should not be done. They do everything whimsically, according to their own desire, and they do not recognize any authority. These demoniac qualities are taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs of their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious qualities. </p>

    <p>
      Lord K???a encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not born with demoniac qualities. His involvement in the fight was not demoniac, because he was considering the pros and cons. He was considering whether respectable persons such as Bhi?ma and Dro?a should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the influence of anger, false prestige or harshness. Therefore he was not of the quality of the demons. For a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya,</i>]]> a military man, shooting arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac. Therefore there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the regulative principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally situated.
    </p>
  </slokas>
<slokas chapter="16" sloka="6">
    <p>Lord K???a, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the Prajapati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does not. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="16" sloka="7">
    <p>In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and regulations which is followed from the beginning. Especially among the Aryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples, those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally. One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, shaving, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.</p>
    <p>
      As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the <![CDATA[<i>Manu-sa?hita,</i>]]> which is the law of the human race. Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the <![CDATA[<i>Manu-sa?hita.</i>]]> Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the <![CDATA[<i>Manu-sa?hita</i>]]> it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grown-up sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the <![CDATA[<i>Manu-sa?hita.</i>]]> But modern education has artificially devised a puffed—up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. The social condition of women is thus not very good now, although those who are married are in a better condition than those who are proclaiming their so-called freedom. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable.

      The demonic conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no cause and effect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance, just as in a dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence. Then when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and there is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of K???a in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita:</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i><it>mayadhyak?e?a prak?ti? suyate sa-caracaram<it>.</it></it></i>]]> "Under My direction the whole material world is moving." In other words, among the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the creation of the world; every one of them has some particular theory of his own. According to them, one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as another, for they do not believe in a standard understanding of the scriptural injunctions.

      The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction. The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But according to <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.

      The demoniac mentality is described here. The demons have no satiation for their lust. They will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material enjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns and chant accordingly. The result is that they become more and more attracted to two things—sex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The word <![CDATA[<i>asuci-vrata?,</i>]]> "unclean vows," is very significant in this connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat-eating; those are their <![CDATA[<i>asuci,</i>]]> unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, by artificial means the world creates a false honor for them. Although they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much advanced.

      The demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money. That is unlimited. He thinks only of how much assessment he has just now and schemes to engage that stock of wealth further and further. For that reason, he does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal gratification. He is enamored by the possessions he has already, such as land, family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of <![CDATA[<i>karma.</i>]]> According to the law of <![CDATA[<i>karma,</i>]]> a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac think that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of one''s personal ability. They do not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep—between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: "Why are you seeking God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don''t believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead." These are the demoniac''s preachings.</p>
    <p>
      Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more influential than he. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing <![CDATA[<i>yajñas,</i>]]> or sacrifices. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of <![CDATA[<i>yajña</i>]]> and prepare some machine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was Rava?a. He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas.</i>]]> Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangements. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit word <![CDATA[<i>moha-jala</i>]]> is very significant. <![CDATA[<i>Jala</i>]]> means "net"; like fish caught in a net, they have no way to come out.

      Thinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, the demoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites. And since they do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This is due to illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. Sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions for one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one''s own path; there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word <![CDATA[<i>avidhi-purvakam,</i>]]> meaning a disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion.

    <p>A demoniac person, being always against God''s supremacy, does not like to believe in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know that the present life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is actually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on other bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the Personality of Godhead, because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false arguments against the existence of God and denies the scriptural authority. He thinks himself independent and powerful in every action. He thinks that since no one can equal him in strength, power or wealth, he can act in any way and no one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the advancement of his sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power. </p>

      In this verse it is clearly indicated that the placing of a particular individual soul in a particular body is the prerogative of the supreme will. The demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i>]]> Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after his death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of body under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material existence we find so many species of life—animals, insects, men, and so on. All are arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the demoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs of demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such demoniac species of men are held to be always full of lust, always violent and hateful and always unclean. The many kinds of hunters in the jungle are considered to belong to the demoniac species of life.<p></p>

      It is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never merciful to the demoniac. It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later life. In the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to this question, in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the <![CDATA[<i>asuras,</i>]]> the demons, in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the <![CDATA[<i>asuras</i>]]> are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are instances in history of many <![CDATA[<i>asuras</i>]]>-Rava?a, Ka?sa, Hira?yakasipu—to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill them. Therefore God''s mercy is shown to the <![CDATA[<i>asuras</i>]]> if they are fortunate enough to be killed by Him.

    <p>The beginning of demoniac life is described herein. One tries to satisfy his lust, and when he cannot, anger and greed arise.

  <slokas chapter="16" sloka="22">
    <p>One should be very careful of these three enemies to human life: lust, anger and greed. The more a person is freed from lust, anger and greed, the more his existence becomes pure. Then he can follow the rules and regulations enjoined in the Vedic literature. By following the regulative principles of human life, one gradually raises himself to the platform of spiritual realization. If one is so fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of K???a consciousness, then success is guaranteed for him. In the Vedic literature, the ways of action and reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification. The whole method is based on giving up lust, greed and anger. By cultivating knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In that devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders of life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual order system. There are different rules and regulations for different castes or divisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization. Then he can have liberation without a doubt. </p>

    <p>
      As described before, the <![CDATA[<i>sastra-vidhi,</i>]]> or the direction of the <![CDATA[<i>sastra,</i>]]> is given to the different castes and orders of human society. Everyone is expected to follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts whimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he never will be perfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically know all these things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately does not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his knowledge becomes spoiled. And even if he accepts the existence of God, if he does not engage himself in the service of the Lord his attempts are spoiled. Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the platform of K???a consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there that he can attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word <![CDATA[<i>kama-karata?</i>]]> is very significant. A person who knowingly violates the rules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, but still he acts. This is called acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but still he does not do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be condemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is meant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one''s existence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify himself, nor can he attain the real stage of happiness.

      As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> are meant for knowing K???a. If one understands K???a from the <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> and becomes situated in K???a consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu made this process very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in K???a consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas.</i>]]> One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called following the principles of <![CDATA[<i>sastra,</i>]]> or scripture. <![CDATA[<i>Sastra</i>]]> is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the <![CDATA[<i>sastra</i>]]>—being above these defects—are accepted without alteration by all great saints, <![CDATA[<i>acaryas</i>]]> and great souls.<p>

          In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist.

One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the <![CDATA[<i>sastras</i>]]> is considered fortunate.

          In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, <![CDATA[<i>maya,</i>]]> the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one''s life becomes successful.

      In the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity. In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an <![CDATA[<i>asura,</i>]]> demon, and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a <![CDATA[<i>deva,</i>]]> or demigod. Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna''s is to be cleared by K???a. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures but who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in their effort?

According to their previous activities in the mode of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature which is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity with the different modes of nature has been going on perpetually; since the living entity is in contact with material nature, he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes. But this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature.</p>

      Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, originally he is <![CDATA[<i>nirgu?a,</i>]]> or transcendental. Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired, in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: K???a consciousness. If one is situated in K???a consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.<p>
        <p>
          The word <![CDATA[<i>sraddha,</i>]]> or "faith," is very significant in this verse. <![CDATA[<i>Sraddha,</i>]]> or faith, originally comes out of the mode of goodness. One''s faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. One''s strong faith is supposed to be productive of works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one''s faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one''s faith is established. It should be understood that if one''s heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.

    <p>In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods include Brahma, Siva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.</p>
    <p>
      Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower-class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Srimad-Bhagavatam</bd-></i>]]><bd>(4.3.23) it is said, <![CDATA[<i>sattva? visuddha? vasudeva-sabditam:</i>]]> "When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships Vasudeva." The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.<p>
          <p>The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi??u form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi??u. Vi??u is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Vi??u form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahma is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature. </p>

    <p>In terms of different situations in the modes of material nature, there are differences in the manner of eating and performing sacrifices, austerities and charities. They are not all conducted on the same level. Those who can understand analytically what kind of performances are in what modes of material nature are actually wise; those who consider all kinds of sacrifice or food or charity to be the same cannot discriminate, and they are foolish. There are missionary workers who advocate that one can do whatever he likes and attain perfection. But these foolish guides are not acting according to the direction of the scripture. They are manufacturing ways and misleading the people in general.</p>

      The purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life''s duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, <![CDATA[<i>dal,</i>]]> whole wheat, etc.<p>
        <p>
          Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by reducing the mucus in the stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except <![CDATA[<i>prasadam,</i>]]> food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.

          Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnants of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. <![CDATA[<i><it>Patra? pu?pa? phala? toyam.</it></i>]]> <it>
            Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts.

    <p>The general tendency is to offer sacrifice with some purpose in mind, but here it is stated that sacrifice should be performed without any such desire. It should be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the performance of rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose of material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables without any purpose of obtaining material benefit. Everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural injunctions. One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place one in the mode of goodness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

      The Supreme Godhead here explains the different kinds of austerity and penance. First He explains the austerities and penances practiced by the body. One should offer, or learn to offer, respect to God or to the demigods, the perfect, qualified <![CDATA[<i>brahma?as</i>]]> and the spiritual master and superiors like father, mother or any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should be given proper respect. One should practice cleansing oneself externally and internally, and he should learn to become simple in behavior. He should not do anything which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunctions. He should not indulge in sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only in marriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy. These are penances and austerities as far as the body is concerned.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="17" sloka="15">
    <p>One should not speak in such a way as to agitate the minds of others. Of course, when a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his students, but such a teacher should not speak to those who are not his students if he will agitate their minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned. Besides that, one should not talk nonsense. The process of speaking in spiritual circles is to say something upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote from scriptural authority to back up what he is saying. At the same time, such talk should be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, one may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech.</p>

      To make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from K???a consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one''s nature is to become K???a conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind''s becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the <![CDATA[<i>Pura?as</i>]]> and the <![CDATA[<i>Mahabharata.</i>]]> One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in K???a consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealings and thereby purify his existence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="17" sloka="18">
    <p>Sometimes penance and austerity are executed to attract people and receive honor, respect and worship from others. Persons in the mode of passion arrange to be worshiped by subordinates and let them wash their feet and offer riches. Such arrangements artificially made by the performance of penances are considered to be in the mode of passion. The results are temporary; they can be continued for some time, but they are not permanent.</p>

    <p>There are instances of foolish penance undertaken by demons like Hira?yakasipu, who performed austere penances to become immortal and kill the demigods.

      In the Vedic literature, charity given to a person engaged in spiritual activities is recommended. There is no recommendation for giving charity indiscriminately. Spiritual perfection is always a consideration. Therefore charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a</i>]]> or a Vai??ava (devotee) or in temples. Such charities should be given without any consideration of return. Charity to the poor is sometimes given out of compassion, but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to, then there is no spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not recommended in the Vedic literature.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="17" sloka="21">
    <p>Charity is sometimes performed for elevation to the heavenly kingdom and sometimes with great trouble and with repentance afterwards: "Why have I spent so much in this way?" Charity is also sometimes given under some obligation, at the request of a superior. These kinds of charity are said to be given in the mode of passion.</p>
    <p>There are many charitable foundations which offer their gifts to institutions where sense gratification goes on. Such charities are not recommended in the Vedic scripture. Only charity in the mode of goodness is recommended.</p>

  <slokas chapter="17" sloka="22">
    <p>Contributions for indulgence in intoxication and gambling are not encouraged here. That sort of contribution is in the mode of ignorance.

      It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme—<![CDATA[<i>o? tat sat,</i>]]> the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal—they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words, <![CDATA[<i>o? tat sat,</i>]]> particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word <![CDATA[<i>o?</i>]]> is always found.
    </p>
    <p>
      One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charity, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the mode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words <![CDATA[<i>o? tat sat</i>]]> are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., <![CDATA[<i>o? tad vi??o?.</i>]]> Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered, <![CDATA[<i>o?</i>]]> is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. <![CDATA[<i>O? ity etad brahma?o nedi??ha? nama</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i>?g Veda</i>]]>) indicates the first goal. Then <![CDATA[<i>tat tvam asi</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Chandogya Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>6.8.7) indicates the second goal. And <![CDATA[<i>sad eva saumya</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Chandogya Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>6.2.1) indicates the third goal. Combined they become <![CDATA[<i>o? tat sat.</i>]]> Formerly when Brahma, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he indicated by these three words the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for <![CDATA[<i>o? tat sat,</i>]]> or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in K???a consciousness. K???a consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way. <p></p></bd></bd>

    <p>Anything done without the transcendental objective—whether it be sacrifice, charity or penance—is useless. Therefore in this verse it is declared that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in K???a consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of K???a. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in K???a consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful.</p>
    <p>In the conditional state, people are attracted to worshiping demigods, ghosts, or Yak?as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K???a consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K???a consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should therefore take to K???a consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter. </p>

      Actually the <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is finished in seventeen chapters. The Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In every chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> Lord K???a stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service: <![CDATA[<i><it>yoginam api sarve?a?... .</it></i>]]><it>
        "Of all <![CDATA[<i>yogis</i>]]> or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best." In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, represented by the words <![CDATA[<i>o? tat sat,</i>]]> which indicate Vi??u, the Supreme Person. The third part of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> has shown that devotional service, and nothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing past <![CDATA[<i>acaryas</i>]]> and the <![CDATA[<i>Brahma-sutra,</i>]]> the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra.</i>]]> Certain impersonalists consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra,</i>]]> but actually the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every <![CDATA[<i>Veda,</i>]]> devotional service is the objective. That is explained in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]><p>
          <p>
            As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> namely renunciation (<![CDATA[<i>tyaga</i>]]>) and the renounced order of life (<![CDATA[<i>sannyasa</i>]]>). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.<p>
              <p>Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord—H??ikesa and Kesi-ni?udana—are significant. H??ikesa is K???a, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equipoised. Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses K???a as Kesi-ni?udana. Kesi was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting K???a to kill the demon of doubt. </p>

      The performance of activities for results has to be given up. This is the instruction of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> But activities leading to advanced spiritual knowledge are not to be given up. This will be made clear in the next verses. In the Vedic literature there are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some particular purpose. There are certain sacrifices to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped. However, sacrifice for the purification of one''s heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should not be given up.

    <p>There are many activities in the Vedic literature which are subjects of contention. For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice, yet some maintain that animal killing is completely abominable. Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific sacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now being clarified by the Lord Himself. </p>

      Although there are differences of opinion about renunciation, here the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a, gives His judgment, which should be taken as final. After all, the <![CDATA[<i>Vedas</i>]]> are different laws given by the Lord. Here the Lord is personally present, and His word should be taken as final. The Lord says that the process of renunciation should be considered in terms of the modes of material nature in which it is performed.

      The <![CDATA[<i>yogis</i>]]> should perform acts for the advancement of human society. There are many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life. The marriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices. It is called <![CDATA[<i>vivaha-yajña.</i>]]> Should a <![CDATA[<i>sannyasi,</i>]]> who is in the renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up. <![CDATA[<i>Vivaha-yajña,</i>]]> the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind so that it may become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this <![CDATA[<i>vivaha-yajña</i>]]> should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life. <![CDATA[<i>Sannyasis</i>]]> should never associate with women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up. Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to suitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual life.

<slokas chapter="18" sloka="6">
    <p>
      Although all sacrifices are purifying, one should not expect any result by such performances. In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one''s existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped. Everything that leads to K???a consciousness must be encouraged. In the <![CDATA[<i><it>Srimad-Bhagavatam</it></i>]]> <it>also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of religion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacrifice or charity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord. <p></p>

      Work for material satisfaction must be given up, but activities which promote one to spiritual activity, like cooking for the Supreme Lord and offering the food to the Lord and then accepting the food, are recommended. It is said that a person in the renounced order of life should not cook for himself. Cooking for oneself is prohibited, but cooking for the Supreme Lord is not prohibited. Similarly, a <![CDATA[<i>sannyasi</i>]]> may perform a marriage ceremony to help his disciple in the advancement of K???a consciousness. If one renounces such activities, it is to be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness.

  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="8">
    <p>One who is in K???a consciousness should not give up earning money out of fear that he is performing fruitive activities. If by working one can engage his money in K???a consciousness, or if by rising early in the morning one can advance his transcendental K???a consciousness, one should not desist out of fear or because such activities are considered troublesome. Such renunciation is in the mode of passion. The result of passionate work is always miserable. If a person renounces work in that spirit, he never gets the result of renunciation. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="9">
    <p>Prescribed duties must be performed with this mentality. One should act without attachment for the result; he should be disassociated from the modes of work. A man working in K???a consciousness in a factory does not associate himself with the work of the factory, nor with the workers of the factory. He simply works for K???a. And when he gives up the result for K???a, he is acting transcendentally. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="10">
    <p>A person in K???a consciousness or in the mode of goodness does not hate anyone or anything which troubles his body. He does work in the proper place and at the proper time without fearing the troublesome effects of his duty. Such a person situated in transcendence should be understood to be most intelligent and beyond all doubts in his activities. </p>
  </slokas>
<slokas chapter="18" sloka="11">
    <p>
      It is said in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> that one can never give up work at any time. Therefore he who works for K???a and does not enjoy the fruitive results, who offers everything to K???a, is actually a renouncer. There are many members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness who work very hard in their office or in the factory or some other place, and whatever they earn they give to the Society. Such highly elevated souls are actually <![CDATA[<i>sannyasis</i>]]> and are situated in the renounced order of life. It is clearly outlined here how to renounce the fruits of work and for what purpose fruits should be renounced.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="12">
    <p>A person in K???a consciousness acting in knowledge of his relationship with K???a is always liberated. Therefore he does not have to enjoy or suffer the results of his acts after death. </p>

  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="13">
    <p>
      A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction, how is it that the person in K???a consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta</i>]]> philosophy to show how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities, and for success in all activity one should consider these five causes. <![CDATA[<i>Sa?khya</i>]]> means the stock of knowledge, and <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta</i>]]> is the final stock of knowledge accepted by all leading <![CDATA[<i>acaryas.</i>]]> Even Sa?kara accepts <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> as such. Therefore such authority should be consulted.

      The ultimate control is invested in the Supersoul. As it is stated in the <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i><it>sarvasya caha? h?di sannivi??a?</it></i>]]><it->
      [<it>Bg<it->. <it>15.15<it->]<![CDATA[<i><it>.</it></i>]]> He is engaging everyone in certain activities by reminding him of his past actions. And K???a conscious acts done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the life after death. <p></p>

      The word <![CDATA[<i>adhi??hanam</i>]]> refers to the body. The soul within the body is acting to bring about the results of activity and is therefore known as <![CDATA[<i>karta,</i>]]> "the doer." That the soul is the knower and the doer is stated in the <![CDATA[<i>sruti.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>E?a hi dra??a sra??a</i>]]> (<![CDATA[<i><bd->Prasna Upani?ad</bd-></i>]]><bd>4.9). It is also confirmed in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]> by the verses <![CDATA[<i><bd->jño ''ta eva</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.3.18) and <![CDATA[<i><bd->karta sastrarthavattvat</bd-></i>]]><bd>(2.3.33). The instruments of action are the senses, and by the senses the soul acts in various ways. For each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one''s activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the supercause. Under these circumstances, he who is acting in K???a consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in complete K???a consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions. Everything is dependent on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <p></p>

    <p>The words "right" and "wrong" are very significant in this verse. Right work is work done in terms of the prescribed directions in the scriptures, and wrong work is work done against the principles of the scriptural injunctions.

<slokas chapter="18" sloka="16">
    <p>A foolish person cannot understand that the Supersoul is sitting as a friend within and conducting his actions. Although the material causes are the place, the worker, the endeavor and the senses, the final cause is the Supreme, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, one should see not only the four material causes but the supreme efficient cause as well. One who does not see the Supreme thinks himself to be the doer. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="17">
    <p>In this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises from false ego. Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did not consider the supreme sanction within and without. If one does not know that a supersanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instruments of work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme sanctioner is perfect in doing everything. Such a person is never in illusion. Personal activity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness, or a lack of K???a consciousness. Anyone who is acting in K???a consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though killing, does not kill. Nor is he ever affected by the reaction of such killing. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he is not subject to be judged. But if a soldier kills on his own personal account, then he is certainly judged by a court of law. </p>

  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="18">
    <p>There are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower. The instruments of work, the work itself and the worker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any human being has these elements. Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called inspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized as a subtle form of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the psychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called impetus. The inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of the spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and the worker is there, then actual activity takes place by the help of the senses, including the mind, which is the center of all the senses. The sum total of all the constituents of an activity are called the accumulation of work. </p>

      In the Fourteenth Chapter the three divisions of the modes of material nature were elaborately described. In that chapter it was said that the mode of goodness is illuminating, the mode of passion materialistic, and the mode of ignorance conducive to laziness and indolence. All the modes of material nature are binding; they are not sources of liberation. Even in the mode of goodness one is conditioned. In the Seventeenth Chapter, the different types of worship by different types of men in different modes of material nature were described. In this verse, the Lord says that He wishes to speak about the different types of knowledge, workers and work itself according to the three material modes.<p></p>
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="20">
    <p>
      A person who sees one spirit soul in every living being, whether a demigod, human being, animal, bird, beast, aquatic or plant, possesses knowledge in the mode of goodness. In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, although they have different bodies in terms of their previous work. As described in the Seventh Chapter, the manifestation of the living force in every body is due to the superior nature of the Supreme Lord. Thus to see that one superior nature, that living force, in every body is to see in the mode of goodness. That living energy is imperishable, although the bodies are perishable. Differences are perceived in terms of the body; because there are many forms of material existence in conditional life, the living force appears to be divided. Such impersonal knowledge is an aspect of self-realization.<p></p>
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="21">
    <p>The concept that the material body is the living entity and that with the destruction of the body the consciousness is also destroyed is called knowledge in the mode of passion. According to that knowledge, bodies differ from one another because of the development of different types of consciousness, otherwise there is no separate soul which manifests consciousness. The body is itself the soul, and there is no separate soul beyond the body. According to such knowledge, consciousness is temporary. Or else there are no individual souls, but there is an all-pervading soul, which is full of knowledge, and this body is a manifestation of temporary ignorance. Or beyond this body there is no special individual or supreme soul. All such conceptions are considered products of the mode of passion.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="22">
    <p>The "knowledge" of the common man is always in the mode of darkness or ignorance because every living entity in conditional life is born into the mode of ignorance. One who does not develop knowledge through the authorities or scriptural injunctions has knowledge that is limited to the body. He is not concerned about acting in terms of the directions of scripture. For him God is money, and knowledge means the satisfaction of bodily demands. Such knowledge has no connection with the Absolute Truth. It is more or less like the knowledge of the ordinary animals: the knowledge of eating, sleeping, defending and mating. Such knowledge is described here as the product of the mode of darkness. In other words, knowledge concerning the spirit soul beyond this body is called knowledge in the mode of goodness, knowledge producing many theories and doctrines by dint of mundane logic and mental speculation is the product of the mode of passion, and knowledge concerned only with keeping the body comfortable is said to be in the mode of ignorance.</p>

  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="23">
    <p>Regulated occupational duties, as prescribed in the scriptures in terms of the different orders and divisions of society, performed without attachment or proprietary rights and therefore without any love or hatred, and performed in K???a consciousness for the satisfaction of the Supreme, without self-satisfaction or self-gratification, are called actions in the mode of goodness. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="25">
    <p>One has to give account of one''s actions to the state or to the agents of the Supreme Lord called the Yamadutas. Irresponsible work is destructive because it destroys the regulative principles of scriptural injunction. It is often based on violence and is distressing to other living entities. Such irresponsible work is carried out in the light of one''s personal experience. This is called illusion. And all such illusory work is a product of the mode of ignorance.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="26">
    <p>A person in K???a consciousness is always transcendental to the material modes of nature. He has no expectations for the result of the work entrusted to him, because he is above false ego and pride. Still, he is always enthusiastic till the completion of such work. He does not worry about the distress undertaken; he is always enthusiastic. He does not care for success or failure; he is equal in both distress and happiness. Such a worker is situated in the mode of goodness. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="27">
    <p>A person is too much attached to a certain kind of work or to the result because he has too much attachment for materialism or hearth and home, wife and children. Such a person has no desire for higher elevation in life. He is simply concerned with making this world as materially comfortable as possible. He is generally very greedy, and he thinks that anything attained by him is permanent and never to be lost. Such a person is envious of others and prepared to do anything wrong for sense gratification. Therefore such a person is unclean, and he does not care whether his earning is pure or impure. He is very happy if his work is successful and very much distressed when his work is not successful. Such is the worker in the mode of passion.</p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="28">
    <p>In the scriptural injunctions we find what sort of work should be performed and what sort of work should not be performed. Those who do not care for those injunctions engage in work not to be done, and such persons are generally materialistic. They work according to the modes of nature, not according to the injunctions of the scripture. Such workers are not very gentle, and generally they are always cunning and expert in insulting others. They are very lazy; even though they have some duty, they do not do it properly, and they put it aside to be done later on. Therefore they appear to be morose. They procrastinate; anything which can be done in an hour they drag on for years. Such workers are situated in the mode of ignorance. </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="29">
    <p>Now after explaining knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower, in three different divisions according to the modes of material nature, the Lord is explaining the intelligence and determination of the worker in the same way.</p>

      Performing actions in terms of the directions of the scriptures is called <![CDATA[<i>prav?tti,</i>]]> or executing actions that deserve to be performed. And actions which are not so directed are not to be performed. One who does not know the scriptural directions becomes entangled in the actions and reactions of work. Understanding which discriminates by intelligence is situated in the mode of goodness.

  </slokas>
<slokas chapter="18" sloka="32">
    <p>Intelligence in the mode of ignorance is always working the opposite of the way it should. It accepts religions which are not actually religions and rejects actual religion. Men in ignorance understand a great soul to be a common man and accept a common man as a great soul. They think truth to be untruth and accept untruth as truth. In all activities they simply take the wrong path; therefore their intelligence is in the mode of ignorance.</p>

The word <![CDATA[<i>avyabhicari?ya</i>]]> is very significant, for it indicates that persons who are engaged in K???a consciousness are never deviated by any other activity.

    <p>It should not be concluded that a person in the mode of goodness does not dream. Here "dream" means too much sleep. Dreaming is always present; either in the mode of goodness, passion or ignorance, dreaming is a natural occurrence. But those who cannot avoid oversleeping, who cannot avoid the pride of enjoying material objects, who are always dreaming of lording it over the material world, and whose life, mind and senses are thus engaged, are considered to have determination in the mode of ignorance. </p>

    <p>A conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again. Thus he chews the chewed. But sometimes, in the course of such enjoyment, he becomes relieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul. In other words, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense gratification, but when he understands by good association that it is only a repetition of the same thing, and he is awakened to his real K???a consciousness, he is sometimes relieved from such repetitive so-called happiness.</p>

      As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all living beings are fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. Thus the Supreme Lord is the beginning of all living entities. This is confirmed in the <![CDATA[<i>Vedanta-sutra</i>]]>-<![CDATA[<i>janmady asya yata?<it->[SB <it>1.1.1<it->]<it>.</it></it-></it></it-></i>]]> 
      The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And as stated in the Seventh Chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally the Vai??ava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as Paramatma is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord one has his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full K???a consciousness. That is recommended in this verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by H??ikesa, the master of the senses. And by the result of the work in which one is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri K???a, should be worshiped. If one thinks always in this way, in full K???a consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in <![CDATA[<i><bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(12.7), <![CDATA[<i>te?am aha? samuddharta.</i>]]> The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest perfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the Supreme Lord he will achieve the highest perfection. <p></p>

      One''s occupational duty is prescribed in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> As already discussed in previous verses, the duties of a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a, k?atriya, vaisya</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>sudra</i>]]> are prescribed according to their particular modes of nature. One should not imitate another''s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by <![CDATA[<i>sudras</i>]]> should not artificially claim to be a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a,</i>]]> although he may have been born into a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a</i>]]> family. In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a</i>]]> is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a.</i>]]> For a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya,</i>]]> or administrator, there are so many abominable things; a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya</i>]]> has to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya</i>]]> has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya</i>]]> is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a.</i>]]>
    </p>
    <p>
      One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya.</i>]]> He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed for the sake of K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, "Oh, my dear customer, for you I am making no profit," but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a.</i>]]> That is not recommended. Whether one is a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya,</i>]]> a <![CDATA[<i>vaisya,</i>]]> or a <![CDATA[<i>sudra</i>]]> doesn''t matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even <![CDATA[<i>brahma?as,</i>]]> who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya</i>]]> engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yajña, or for Vi??u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.

      In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature. Even if one is a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a,</i>]]> he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya,</i>]]> however pious he may be, has to fight enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a <![CDATA[<i>sudra</i>]]> serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to give up the work of a <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya</i>]]> and take up the occupation of a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a,</i>]]> he is not assured that in the occupation of a <![CDATA[<i>brahma?a</i>]]> there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in K???a consciousness. That is the perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is self-realization.

      Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore think that he has no right to enjoy the results of his work. Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually K???a consciousness. The person acting in K???a consciousness is really a <![CDATA[<i>sannyasi,</i>]]> one in the renounced order of life. By such a mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A <![CDATA[<i>sannyasi</i>]]> is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in K???a consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called <![CDATA[<i>yogaru?ha,</i>]]> or the perfectional stage of <![CDATA[<i>yoga.</i>]]> As confirmed in the Third Chapter, <![CDATA[<i>
        <it>
          yas tv atma-ratir eva syat<it>:</it>

    <p>The Lord describes for Arjuna how one can achieve the highest perfectional stage simply by being engaged in his occupational duty, performing that duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One attains the supreme stage of Brahman simply by renouncing the result of his work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. That is the process of self-realization. The actual perfection of knowledge is in attaining pure K???a consciousness; that is described in the following verses. </p>

<slokas chapter="18" sloka="54">
    <p>
      To the impersonalist, achieving the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-bhuta</i>]]> stage, becoming one with the Absolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to go still further, to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called <![CDATA[<i>brahma-bhuta <it->[<it>SB 4.30.20<it->]<it>,</it></it-></it></it-></i>]]> oneness with the Absolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in K???a consciousness has nothing for which to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God''s service, in K???a consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than K???a, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or aspire for gain, because he is full in the service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment, because he knows that every living entity is a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-bhuta</i>]]> stage<![CDATA[<i><it->[<it>SB 4.30.20<it->]<it></it></it-></it></it-></i>]]>, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one''s individuality becomes hellish, the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like serpents whose poison teeth are broken. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaiku??ha, or the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service in this age.

      The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, and His plenary portions cannot be understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If anyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee. Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be hidden. As already stated in <![CDATA[<i><bd->Bhagavad-gita</bd-></i>]]><bd>(7.25), <![CDATA[<i>naha? prakasa? sarvasya:</i>]]> He is not revealed to everyone. No one can understand God simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in K???a consciousness and devotional service can understand what K???a is. University degrees are not helpful.<p>
          <p>
            One who is fully conversant with the K???a science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of K???a. Becoming Brahman does not mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation. Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure K???a consciousness. One should not mistakenly think that the word <![CDATA[<i>visate,</i>]]> "enters into Me," supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman. No. <![CDATA[<i>Visate</i>]]> means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in one''s individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.<p>
              <p>
                After attainment of the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-bhuta <it->[<it>SB 4.30.20<it->]</it-></it></it-></i>]]><it>stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one''s hearing about the Lord. When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-bhuta</i>]]> stage develops, and material contamination—greediness and lust for sense enjoyment—disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam</i>]]> also. After liberation the process of <![CDATA[<i>bhakti,</i>]]> or transcendental service, continues. The <![CDATA[<i><bd->Vedanta-sutra</bd-></i>]]><bd>(4.1.12) confirms this: <![CDATA[<i>a-praya?at tatrapi hi d???am.</i>]]> This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues. In the <![CDATA[<i>Srimad-Bhagavatam,</i>]]> real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is a part-and-parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life. <p></p>

      The word <![CDATA[<i>mad-vyapasraya?</i>]]> means under the protection of the Supreme Lord. To be free from material contamination, a pure devotee acts under the direction of the Supreme Lord or His representative, the spiritual master. There is no time limitation for a pure devotee. He is always, twenty-four hours a day, one hundred percent engaged in activities under the direction of the Supreme Lord. To a devotee who is thus engaged in K???a consciousness the Lord is very, very kind. In spite of all difficulties, he is eventually placed in the transcendental abode, or K???aloka. He is guaranteed entrance there; there is no doubt about it. In that supreme abode, there is no change; everything is eternal, imperishable and full of knowledge.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="57">
    <p>
      When one acts in K???a consciousness, he does not act as the master of the world. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master is unaffected by profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the personal direction of K???a but when K???a is not present how should one act? If one acts according to the direction of K???a in this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative of K???a, then the result will be the same. The Sanskrit word <![CDATA[<i>mat-para?</i>]]> is very important in this verse. It indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in K???a consciousness just to satisfy K???a. And while working in that way, one should think of K???a only: "I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by K???a." While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of K???a. This is perfect K???a consciousness. One should, however, note that after doing something whimsically he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of duty is not in the devotional service of K???a consciousness. One should act according to the order of K???a. This is a very important point. That order of K???a comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. Therefore the spiritual master''s order should be taken as the prime duty of life. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then one''s perfection of life in K???a consciousness is guaranteed.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="58">
    <p>A person in full K???a consciousness is not unduly anxious about executing the duties of his existence. The foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all anxiety. For one who acts in K???a consciousness, Lord K???a becomes the most intimate friend. He always looks after His friend''s comfort, and He gives Himself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged working twenty-four hours a day to please the Lord. Therefore, no one should be carried away by the false ego of the bodily concept of life. One should not falsely think himself independent of the laws of material nature or free to act. He is already under strict material laws. But as soon as he acts in K???a consciousness, he is liberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully that one who is not active in K???a consciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who acts in K???a consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by K???a from within and confirmed by the spiritual master. </p>

  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="59">
    <p>
      Arjuna was a military man, and born of the nature of the <![CDATA[<i>k?atriya.</i>]]> Therefore his natural duty was to fight. But due to false ego he was fearing that by killing his teacher, grandfather and friends he would incur sinful reactions. Actually he was considering himself master of his actions, as if he were directing the good and bad results of such work. He forgot that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present there, instructing him to fight. That is the forgetfulness of the conditioned soul. The Supreme Personality gives directions as to what is good and what is bad, and one simply has to act in K???a consciousness to attain the perfection of life. No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and act. No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master, who is the representative of God. One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead—that will keep one safe under all circumstances.

    <p>If one refuses to act under the direction of the Supreme Lord, then he is compelled to act by the modes in which he is situated.

<slokas chapter="18" sloka="61">
    <p>Arjuna was not the supreme knower, and his decision to fight or not to fight was confined to his limited discretion. Lord K???a instructed that the individual is not all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, K???a, as the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body, which is created in the material energy under the direction of the Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a high-speed motorcar goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity so that he may work according to his past desires. The living entity is not independent. One should not think himself independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The individual is always under the Lord''s control. Therefore one''s duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse.</p>

  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="62">
    <p>
      A living entity should therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone''s heart, and that will relieve him from all kinds of miseries of this material existence. By such surrender, not only will one be released from all miseries in this life, but at the end he will reach the Supreme God. The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature (<![CDATA[<i><bd->?g Veda</bd-></i>]]><bd>1.22.20) as <![CDATA[<i>tad vi??o? parama? padam.</i>]]> Since all of creation is the kingdom of God, everything material is actually spiritual, but <![CDATA[<i>parama? padam</i>]]> specifically refers to the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual sky or Vaiku??ha.<p>
        <p>
          In the Fifteenth Chapter of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> it is stated, <![CDATA[<i><it>sarvasya caha? h?di sannivi??a?<it>:</it></it></i>]]><it>
            <it->
            [<it>Bg<it->. <it>15.15<it->]<it>the Lord is seated in everyone''s heart. So this recommendation that one should surrender unto the Supersoul sitting within means that one should surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. K???a has already been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme. He was accepted in the Tenth Chapter as <![CDATA[<i><it>para? brahma para? dhama<it>.</it></it></i>]]><it>
                          <it>
                            Arjuna has accepted K???a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the supreme abode of all living entities, not only because of his personal experience but also because of the evidence of great authorities like Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. <p></p>

      The Lord has already explained to Arjuna the knowledge of <![CDATA[<i>brahma-bhuta <it->[<it>SB 4.30.20<it->]<it>.</it></it-></it></it-></i>]]> One who is in the <![CDATA[<i>brahma-bhuta</i>]]> condition is joyful; he never laments, nor does he desire anything. That is due to confidential knowledge. K???a also discloses knowledge of the Supersoul. This is also Brahman knowledge, knowledge of Brahman, but it is superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the words <![CDATA[<i>yathecchasi tatha kuru</i>]]>—"As you like, you may act"—indicate that God does not interfere with the little independence of the living entity. In <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> the Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition. The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated within his heart. By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to the order of the Supersoul. That will help one become situated constantly in K???a consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is being directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight. Surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in the best interest of the living entities. It is not for the interest of the Supreme. Before surrendering, one is free to deliberate on this subject as far as the intelligence goes; that is the best way to accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such instruction comes also through the spiritual master, the bona fide representative of K???a.

  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="64">
    <p>
      The Lord has given Arjuna knowledge that is confidential (knowledge of Brahman) and still more confidential (knowledge of the Supersoul within everyone''s heart), and now He is giving the most confidential part of knowledge: just surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the end of the Ninth Chapter He has said, <![CDATA[<i><it>man-mana?<it>:</it></it></i>]]> "Just always think of Me." The same instruction is repeated here to stress the essence of the teachings of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> This essence is not understood by a common man, but by one who is actually very dear to K???a, a pure devotee of K???a. This is the most important instruction in all Vedic literature. What K???a is saying in this connection is the most essential part of knowledge, and it should be carried out not only by Arjuna but by all living entities.
    </p>
  </slokas>
  <slokas chapter="18" sloka="65">
    <p>The most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee of K???a and always think of Him and act for Him. One should not become an official meditator. Life should be so molded that one will always have the chance to think of K???a. One should always act in such a way that all his daily activities are in connection with K???a. He should arrange his life in such a way that throughout the twenty-four hours he cannot but think of K???a. And the Lord''s promise is that anyone who is in such pure K???a consciousness will certainly return to the abode of K???a, where he will be engaged in the association of K???a face to face. This most confidential part of knowledge is spoken to Arjuna because he is the dear friend of K???a. Everyone who follows the path of Arjuna can become a dear friend to K???a and obtain the same perfection as Arjuna.</p>
    <p>
      These words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon K???a—the very form with two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a beautiful face and peacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of K???a found in the <![CDATA[<i><it>Brahma-sa?hita</it></i>]]> <it>and other literatures. One should fix his mind on this original form of Godhead, K???a. One should not even divert his attention to other forms of the Lord. The Lord has multiforms as Vi??u, Naraya?a, Rama, Varaha, etc., but a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before Arjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of K???a constitutes the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna is the most dear friend of K???a''s. <p></p>
      </it>

<slokas chapter="18" sloka="66">
    <p>
      The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge and processes of religion—knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to K???a. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Seventh Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord K???a. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to Sri K???a he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept K???a as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.<p>
        <p>
          The process of surrender to K???a is described in the <![CDATA[<i><bd->Hari-bhakti-vilasa</bd-></i>]]><bd>(11.676):<p>
              <p>
                anukulyasya sa?kalpa?<br/>
                pratikulyasya varjanam<br/>

                ?a?-vidha sara?agati?
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of K???a consciousness, all his activities are in vain. Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of K???a consciousness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances K???a will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together. K???a will see to that. One should always think himself helpless and should consider K???a the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full K???a consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic <![CDATA[<i>yoga</i>]]> system, etc., but one who surrenders unto K???a does not have to execute so many methods. That simple surrender unto K???a will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of K???a. His name is K???a because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of K???a is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists—some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as K???a Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to K???a, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> <![CDATA[<i>Karma-yogis,</i>]]> empiric philosophers, mystics and devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used here, <![CDATA[<i>ma suca?,</i>]]> "Don''t fear, don''t hesitate, don''t worry," are very significant. One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and simply surrender unto K???a, but such worry is useless.

It is, however, sometimes found that even demoniac persons who are envious of K???a, worshiping K???a in a different way, take to the profession of explaining <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> in a different way to make business, but anyone who desires actually to understand K???a must avoid such commentaries on <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> Actually the purpose of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is not understandable to those who are sensuous. Even if one is not sensuous but is strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the Vedic scripture, if he is not a devotee he also cannot understand K???a.

There are many persons who envy K???a because He has explained in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> that He is the Supreme and that nothing is above Him or equal to Him. There are many persons who are envious of K???a. Such persons should not be told of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> for they cannot understand.

It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead.

      In the sixty-seventh verse of this chapter, the Lord explicitly forbade the <![CDATA[<i>Gita''s</i>]]> being spoken to those who are envious of the Lord. In other words, <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is for the devotees only. But it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord will hold open class, and in that class not all the students are expected to be devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that although not everyone is a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious of K???a. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by hearing <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally those who are free from sinful reactions, those who are righteous, very easily take to K???a consciousness. The word <![CDATA[<i>pu?ya-karma?am</i>]]> is very significant here. This refers to the performance of great sacrifices, like the <![CDATA[<i>asvamedha-yajña,</i>]]> mentioned in the Vedic literature. Those who are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain the planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Maharaja is presiding. He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet, which is called the polestar.

      The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the whole <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> if so required. Actually, anyone who hears <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> from a bona fide spiritual master like K???a or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person fortunate enough to hear these teachings from K???a or from His bona fide spiritual representative is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance.

      The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for self-discipline. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity''s constitutional position is to be a servitor; he has to serve either the illusory <![CDATA[<i>maya</i>]]> or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of <![CDATA[<i>maya</i>]]> to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word <![CDATA[<i>moha</i>]]> is very important in this verse. <![CDATA[<i>Moha</i>]]> refers to that which is opposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally a servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not a servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in K???a consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      K???a consciousness is acting according to K???a''s order. A conditioned soul, illusioned by the external energy of matter, does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of <![CDATA[<i>maya.</i>]]> Arjuna, however, after hearing <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that K???a was not only his friend but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood K???a factually. So to study <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is to understand K???a factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to K???a. When Arjuna understood that it was K???a''s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to K???a''s desire. He again took up his weapons—his arrows and bow—to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

      In the beginning of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> Dh?tara??ra inquired from his secretary Sañjaya, "What happened on the Battlefield of Kuruk?etra?" The entire study was related to the heart of Sañjaya by the grace of his spiritual master, Vyasa. He thus explained the theme of the battlefield. The conversation was wonderful because such an important conversation between two great souls had never taken place before and would not take place again. It was wonderful because the Supreme Personality of Godhead was speaking about Himself and His energies to the living entity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord. If we follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K???a, then our life will be happy and successful. Sañjaya realized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to Dh?tara??ra. Now it is concluded that wherever there is K???a and Arjuna, there is victory.<p></p>

    <p>
      Vyasa was the spiritual master of Sañjaya, and Sañjaya admits that it was by Vyasa''s mercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that one has to understand K???a not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is still direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic succession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and <![CDATA[<i>yogis</i>]]> all over the world, but K???a is the master of all <![CDATA[<i>yoga</i>]]> systems. K???a''s instruction is explicitly stated in <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]>-surrender unto K???a. One who does so is the topmost <![CDATA[<i>yogi.</i>]]> This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. <![CDATA[<i><it>Yoginam api sarve?am.</it></i>]]><it>
        <p>
          <p>
            Narada is the direct disciple of K???a and the spiritual master of Vyasa. Therefore Vyasa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession, and Sañjaya is the direct disciple of Vyasa. Therefore by the grace of Vyasa, Sañjaya''s senses were purified, and he could see and hear K???a directly. One who directly hears K???a can understand this confidential knowledge. If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear K???a; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is concerned.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita,</i>]]> all the <![CDATA[<i>yoga</i>]]> systems—<![CDATA[<i>karma-yoga, jñana-yoga</i>]]> and <![CDATA[<i>bhakti-yoga</i>]]>—are explained. K???a is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand K???a directly, so, by the grace of Vyasa, Sañjaya was also able to hear K???a directly. Actually there is no difference between hearing directly from K???a and hearing directly from K???a via a bona fide spiritual master like Vyasa. The spiritual master is the representative of Vyasadeva also. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual master the disciples conduct the ceremony called Vyasa-puja.

      The understanding of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is so transcendental that anyone who becomes conversant with the topics of Arjuna and K???a becomes righteous and he cannot forget such talks. This is the transcendental position of spiritual life. In other words, one who hears the <![CDATA[<i>Gita</i>]]> from the right source, directly from K???a, attains full K???a consciousness. The result of K???a consciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment.

      The <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> began with an inquiry of Dh?tara??ra''s. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhi?ma, Dro?a and Kar?a. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after describing the scene on the battlefield, Sañjaya told the King, "You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where K???a and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune." He directly confirmed that Dh?tara??ra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K???a was there. K???a''s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. K???a is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K???a is also the master of renunciation.
    </p>
    <p>The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi??hira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi??hira. Because K???a and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhi??hira, Yudhi??hira''s victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sañjaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhi??hira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi??hira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.</p>
    <p>
      There are many less intelligent persons who take <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that K???a incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: <![CDATA[<i><it>man-mana bhava mad-bhakta?<it>.</it></it></i>]]> One must become a devotee of K???a, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K???a (<![CDATA[<i><it>sarva-dharman parityajya mam eka? sara?a? vraja</it></i>]]><it>). The instructions of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the <![CDATA[<i>Gita</i>]]> is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K???a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.<p>
          <p>
            From <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K???a is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita.</i>]]> The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential. And surrender unto K???a in devotional service in full K???a consciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another feature of <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K???a. If one understands K???a, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K???a is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K???a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <![CDATA[<i>Bhagavad-gita</i>]]> five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma and any other transcendental conception—exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya''s philosophy is that of "inconceivable oneness and difference." This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.
          </p>
          <p>The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord K???a may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of K???a, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K???a. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency. </p>
          <p>
            Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the Srimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of its Conclusion-the Perfection of Renunciation.
